"Washington D.C. – In the midst of a contentious political climate, lawmakers in the nation’s capital are facing increasing pressure to find common ground on a variety of pressing issues.

From immigration reform to healthcare, gun control to climate change, the list of divisive topics is long and the stakes are high. With the 2022 midterm elections fast approaching, politicians on both sides of the aisle are feeling the heat to deliver results for their constituents.

One issue that has dominated the headlines in recent weeks is the",1
"Machine learning is a rapidly growing field of study that is changing the way that we interact with technology. This interdisciplinary field involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning has already made significant contributions to fields such as natural language processing, image recognition, and predictive analysis, and it is poised to revolutionize many other industries in the years to come.

At its core, machine learning is all about teaching computers to recognize patterns in data. This can be done in a variety of ways, depending on the type of data being analyzed and the specific goals of the project. For example, in image recognition tasks, machine learning algorithms may be trained to identify certain features in an image, such as edges or corners, and use these features to classify the image as belonging to a certain category. In natural language processing, machine learning algorithms can be used to teach computers to understand and generate human language, which has important applications in areas such as customer service and virtual assistants.

One of the most exciting aspects of machine learning is its potential to transform industries that have traditionally relied on manual labor or human expertise. For example, in the field of medicine, machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze large datasets of patient information and identify patterns that may be missed by human doctors. This can lead to earlier diagnoses and more accurate treatment recommendations, ultimately saving lives.

However, as with any new technology, there are also concerns about the potential downsides of machine learning. One of the biggest concerns is that machine learning algorithms may perpetuate or even amplify existing biases in society, particularly if they are trained on biased data. For example, if a machine learning algorithm is trained on data that contains racial biases, it may learn to perpetuate those biases in its predictions and recommendations, leading to unfair treatment of certain groups of people.

Despite these concerns, the potential benefits of machine learning are too great to ignore. As this field continues to grow and mature, we can expect to see more applications of machine learning in a wide range of fields, from finance to transportation to entertainment. While it is important to approach this technology cautiously and thoughtfully, there is no doubt that machine learning will play a crucial role in shaping our future.",1
"enough for the state to prove that George Zimmerman acted unwisely in following Martin. Under Florida law, George Zimmerman had no responsibility to—at any point—retreat. The state must prove that Zimmerman had no reasonable fear for his life. Moreover, it is not enough for the jury to find

Zimmerman's story fishy. Again, the jury instructions:

George Zimmerman has entered a plea of not guilty. This means you must presume or believe George Zimmerman is innocent. The presumption stays with George Zimmerman as to each material allegation in the Information through each stage of the trial unless it has been overcome by the evidence to the exclusion of and beyond a reasonable doubt. To overcome George Zimmerman's presumption of innocence, the State has the burden of proving the crime with which George Zimmerman is charged was committed and George Zimmerman is the person who committed the crime. George Zimmerman is not required to present evidence or prove anything. Whenever the words ""reasonable doubt"" are used you must consider the following: A reasonable doubt is not a mere possible doubt, a speculative, imaginary or forced doubt. Such a doubt must not influence you to return a verdict of not guilty if you have an abiding conviction of guilt. On the other hand if, after carefully considering, comparing and weighing all the evidence, there is not an abiding conviction of guilt, or, if having a conviction, it is one which is not stable but one which wavers and vacillates, then the charge is not proved beyond every reasonable doubt and you must find George Zimmerman not guilty because the doubt is reasonable. It is to the evidence introduced in this trial, and to it alone, that you are to look for that proof. A reasonable doubt as to the guilt of George Zimmerman may arise from the evidence, conflict in the evidence, or the lack of evidence. If you have a reasonable doubt, you should find George Zimmerman not guilty. If you have no reasonable doubt, you should find George Zimmerman guilty.

This was the job given to the state of Florida. I have seen nothing within the actual case presented by the prosecution that would allow for a stable and unvacillating belief that George Zimmerman was guilty.

That conclusion should not offer you security or comfort. It should not leave you secure in the wisdom of our laws. On the contrary, it should greatly trouble you. But if you are simply focusing on what happened in the courtroom, then you have been head-faked by history and you have bought into an idea of fairness which can not possibly exist.

The injustice inherent in the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman was not authored by a jury given a weak case. The jury's performance may be the least disturbing aspect of this entire affair. The injustice was authored by a country which has taken as its policy, for the lionshare of its history, to erect a pariah class. The killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman is not an error in programming. It is the correct result of forces we set in motion years ago and have done very little to arrest.

One need only look the criminalization of Martin across the country. Perhaps you have been lucky enough to not receive the above ""portrait"" of Trayvon Martin and its accompanying text. The portrait is actually of a 32-year old man. Perhaps you were lucky enough to not see the Trayvon Martin imagery used for target practice (by law enforcement, no less.) Perhaps you did not see the iPhone games. Or maybe you missed the theory presently being floated by Zimmerman's family that Martin was a gun-runner and drug-dealer in training, that texts and tweets he sent mark him as a criminal in waiting. Or the theory floated that the mere donning of a hoodie marks you a thug, leaving one wondering why this guy is a criminal and this one is not.

We have spent much of this year outlining the ways in which American policy has placed black people outside of the law. We are now being told that after having pursued such policies for 200 years, after codifying violence in slavery, after a people conceived in mass rape, after permitting the disenfranchisement of black people through violence, after Draft riots, after white-lines, white leagues, and red shirts, after terrorism, after standing aside for the better reduction of Rosewood and the improvement of Tulsa, after the coup d'etat in Wilmington, after Airport Homes and Cicero, after Ossian Sweet, after Arthur Lee McDuffie, after Anthony Baez, Amadou Diallo and Eleanor Bumpers, after Kathryn Johnston and the Danziger Bridge, that there are no ill effects, that we are pure, that we are just, that we are clean. Our sense of self is incredible. We believe ourselves to have inherited all of Jefferson's love of freedom, but none of his affection for white supremacy.",0

HE ARRIVED in Houston with $500 in his pocket. A man he met on the Greyhound bus gave him a room until he found his feet. Zaher El-Ali, a Jordanian immigrant, worked hard and built up a small business renovating and selling cars and houses. He is now a proud American citizen. But, ridiculous though it sounds, his truck is in trouble with the law.

Six years ago, he sold a Chevy Silverado to a man who agreed to pay for it in instalments. Before the truck was paid off, the buyer was arrested for drunken driving. It was his third such arrest, so he was sent to prison and the police seized the truck. Mr Ali applied to get it back. He pointed out that he still held title to the vehicle, and that since the buyer had stopped making payments on it, he was entitled to reclaim it. But the government refused.

In most states the police can seize property they suspect has been used to commit a crime. Under ""civil asset forfeiture"" laws, they typically do not have to prove ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that a crime was committed, or even charge anyone with an offence. What is more, the money raised by auctioning seized houses, boats and cars is often used to boost the budgets of the police department that did the seizing. That can mean fancier patrol cars, badass hardware or simply keeping the budget plump in lean times. In one survey 40% of police executives agreed that funds from civil-asset forfeiture were ""necessary as a budget supplement"". This conflict of interest has predictable consequences. It spurs the police to pay more attention to cases that are likely to involve seizable assets (such as drug busts) and less attention to other ones. A report from the Institute for Justice, a pressure group, calls it ""Policing for Profit"".

An owner can usually challenge a seizure by arguing that he did not know his property was being used for criminal purposes. But in 38 out of 50 states, the burden of proof is on him to prove his innocence. In February Texas demanded to know from Mr Ali whether he had asked the buyer about his previous arrests for drunk driving—as if that were a car dealer's responsibility. It also demanded a sheaf of irrelevant documents, such as Mr Ali's bank and tax records for the past two years. Mr Ali's lawyer, Scott Bullock, argues that this is ""clearly designed to intimidate"" Mr Ali into giving up. Instead, he is suing to have the Texas civil asset forfeiture law struck down.

Civil and criminal asset forfeiture laws are often confused. Criminal forfeiture involves proven criminals. A convicted bank robber may lose his getaway car; a money-launderer may lose the house he bought with his illicit profits. Civil forfeiture is different. No conviction is necessary. If the government suspects that property has been used in the commission of a crime, it files an action against the property itself. This leads to odd case names, such as State of Texas v One 2004 Chevrolet Silverado (Mr Ali's case) and United States v $10,500.

Even in states where local rules make civil asset forfeiture hard, police can get around that problem by calling in the feds. After a joint operation by state and federal authorities, the proceeds are split. This is called ""equitable sharing"". Police respond to these incentives exactly as you would expect them to. Where state law makes it tricky for them to seize property and hang on to it, they seize significantly more via ""equitable sharing"", according to Marian Williams and Jeff Holcomb of Appalachian State University and Tomislav Kovandzic of the University of Texas, Dallas. Total federal seizures have exploded from $400m in 2001 to $1.3 billion in 2008. State data are patchier, but the trend appears to be sharply upward.

Police and prosecutors deny that the system is widely abused. Scott Burns of the National District Attorneys Association says that elected sheriffs would be punished at the polls if they went around seizing property without good cause. But the safeguards are slender. For instance, police can find a wad of cash in a car, claim that the owner was planning to buy drugs with it, and then seize it. The evidence may be simply that a dog smelled drugs; yet one test found that a third of banknotes have traces of cocaine on them. The poor are disproportionately at risk, since people without credit cards are more likely to carry cash. And since the sum seized is often less than the legal costs of trying to get it back, many people never try.

By and large, the police do a dangerous job honourably. But they are human, so giving them a financial incentive to seize people's property is dotty. Why should the money not be put in the general pot of public funds? And seizing a citizen's assets without proving",0
"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has captured the attention of the world, as tensions between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists continue to escalate. With both sides accusing each other of violating ceasefires and committing war crimes, the situation remains tense and uncertain.

The conflict first began in 2014, when pro-Russian separatists seized control of Crimea, a Ukrainian territory. Since then, fighting has erupted in various parts of eastern Ukraine, as Ukrainian forces attempt to regain control and separatists fight for independence.

While both sides have suffered casualties, civilians have borne the brunt of the violence. According to the United Nations, over 13,000 people have been killed and more than 30,000 injured since the conflict began. In addition, over 1.5 million people have been displaced from their homes, creating a humanitarian crisis.

International organizations and governments have attempted to broker a peace agreement, but so far these attempts have been unsuccessful. The Minsk II agreement, signed in February 2015, called for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons, but fighting has continued despite the agreement.

The conflict has also strained relations between Russia and the West. The United States and European Union have imposed economic sanctions on Russia, accusing it of supporting the separatists and violating Ukraine's sovereignty. Russia denies these allegations and has accused the West of meddling in its affairs.

As the conflict drags on, the humanitarian situation worsens and both sides continue to suffer losses. The international community must continue to work towards a peaceful resolution, ensuring that civilians are protected and the sovereignty of Ukraine is respected.",1
"Generative AI: The Future of Innovation and Creativity

In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence has seen a significant advancement in the area of generative AI, which has the potential to revolutionize the way we create and innovate. Generative AI refers to a subset of AI techniques that can generate new data, images, and even entire worlds that did not exist before. This technology has already been applied in a variety of fields, including art, music, gaming, and even drug discovery.

One of the most exciting applications of generative AI is in the field of art. Artists and designers can now use generative AI tools to create unique and original pieces of art that would have been impossible to create otherwise. For example, the artist Robbie Barrat used generative AI to create a series of portraits that were auctioned off for thousands of dollars. Banksy, the anonymous street artist, also recently used generative AI to create a piece of art that was auctioned off for over $400,000.

In the music industry, generative AI has been used to create new sounds and compositions. The musician Taryn Southern, for example, used generative AI to compose an entire album called ""I AM AI."" The album features songs that were entirely composed using generative AI tools, and it has received critical acclaim and millions of streams on various platforms.

Generative AI is also being used in the gaming industry to create more immersive and realistic game worlds. The popular video game No Man's Sky uses generative AI to create an entire universe of planets, creatures, and landscapes that the player can explore. The technology behind No Man's Sky's generative AI is so advanced that the game's creators have stated that it would take billions of years to explore all the planets in the game.

In drug discovery, generative AI is being used to create new molecules that can potentially be used to treat diseases. The company Atomwise, for example, uses generative AI to create new drug candidates that are optimized for specific disease targets. This technology has the potential to significantly speed up the drug discovery process, which can take years and cost billions of dollars.

In conclusion, generative AI has the potential to change the way we create and innovate in various fields. From art and music to gaming and drug discovery, the technology is opening up new possibilities that were previously unimaginable. As the technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see even more exciting applications of generative AI in the years to come.",1

"Horseshoe Bridge in Perth provides vital cross city traffic link 112 years after opening

Posted

Perth's Horseshoe Bridge — named for its unusual shape — continues to be a vital link for cross-city traffic, even though the railway line it once spanned is now underground.

""This is one of Perth's icons,"" Richard Offen, executive director of Heritage Perth, told 720 ABC Perth.

""Everyone knows of the Horseshoe Bridge because of its unusual shape.""

The bridge connects the city and the Northbridge section of William Street.

Its birth came during Western Australia's first mining boom — the gold rushes of the 1890s.

""When the Guildford to Fremantle railway line opened in 1880 there was actually a gated level crossing here at William Street,"" Mr Offen said.

""Each time a train came through a gatekeeper would come out and [open and] shut the gates — there were none of these modern boom gates.

""As the population grew during the gold rush, the frequency of trains grew and so did the road traffic.

""The result was gridlock in Perth.""

A footbridge for pedestrians was built in 1896.

Controversy arises after bridge opening

By 1903, the State Government realised it also needed to build a traffic bridge across the railway line — but there was a hitch.

""Because the buildings on William Street were quite close to the railway line on both sides, there was going to be a problem building a conventional straight bridge,"" Mr Offen said.

It was Robert Howard, a draftsman in the Public Works Department, who hit on the idea of bending the bridge around the buildings.

""The bridge opened in 1904,"" Mr Offen said.

""But it was immediately surrounded by controversy, because there were plans to demolish the wooden footbridge and an awful lot of people started complaining about it.

""Somebody worked out that they would have to travel an extra mile each week because the horseshoe bridge was longer.""

The Daily News took up the issue, chastising the pedestrian opponents, in an editorial on July 8, 1904:

The structure had been built practically on the lines desired by the people, and now objection was being raised to the unsightly wooden footbridge which was never intended to be a permanent structure. It was a menace to the safety of the railways, and yet after all that had been done to meet the citizens' desires some people wanted two bridges instead of one.

""As usual, things calmed down and people forgot about that and realised that there were no more traffic jams,"" Mr Offen said.

The bridge was in use until 2009 when it closed for seven months for repairs.

In 2010, work began on the $360 million Perth City Link, which involved sinking the railway line under the Horseshoe Bridge and opening up 13 hectares of land for development between Northbridge and the CBD.

Trains began running underground on July 18, 2013.

The space between the arms of the Horseshoe Bridge is now being developed into a public precinct called Yagan Square.

And although the bridge no longer spans the railway line, it is still in use and now listed on the state heritage register.

""There aren't many bridges of this shape in the world and it has played a unique part in Perth's transport history,"" Mr Offen said.

""They have kept the gorgeous pedestal lamps which light the bridge and it is now going to be a wonderful backdrop for the new Yagan Square when that opens.""

"MANILA — Beheadings must stop. This was the curt reaction of Davao City Mayor and presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte on the beheading of Canadian John Ridsdel by his Abu Sayyaf kidnappers on Monday (Apr. 25).

Duterte, who was in North Cotabato, to facilitate the release of a soldier from the New People's Army, refused to comment at length on the beheading.

""It's too early to comment,"" he said. ""I'm not yet the president of the Philippines. But this has to stop,"" he added.

In Negros Occidental, Liberal Party presidential candidate Mar Roxas expressed his outrage over Ridsdel's beheading.

""The Abu Sayyaf Group must be extinguished,"" he told a press conference in La Carlota City, Negros Occidental.

""I am outraged by the horrific murder of Mr. John Ridsel at the hands of the terrorist Abu Sayyaf. The full force of the state and of the law must be applied to apprehend and bring the perpetrators to justice,"" he added.

He said that since the abduction of Ridsel and the other hostages was reported, all means have been sought to free them.

""Let us double our efforts. Let us not give up hope that the others can be rescued,"" he said, as he appealed for the cooperation and support of all in this mission.

""Terrorism is bullying at its most worst form,"" he said. ""Why kill a defenseless man just to make a point.""

""Terrorism preys on the weak and defenseless. Where is the courage in hurting let alone killing a defenseless person. It does not make you strong. It does not further your cause. It only leads to fear and subjugation which we know is your true purpose and we will not be cowed by that,"" he said.

Roxas extended his condolences to the family, loved ones and fellow citizens of Ridsel.

""The terrorists Abu Sayyaf should be should be neutralized and face the immeasurable consequences of their brutality and inhumanity,"" he said.

He said the 400 Abu Sayyaf members reported to have massed up on Sulu Island, should not be allowed to escape, and should be finished off.

""There is no room for the brutality exercised by the Abu Sayyaf…they must be extinguished,"" he said.

The Abu Sayyaf killed Ridsdel on Monday and dumped his head on a Jolo street, Sulu.

The Abu Sayyaf is still holding another Canadian, a Filipina and a Norwegian resort manager. SFM

"Great Book not right for everyone

Excellent narration is the cap to the fascinating and enjoyable novel. As much as I enjoyed this novel, I can see that many people would really not appreciate it. This is largely an inner stream of consciousness and there are a lot of four letter words and frank thoughts about sex and death. In the first chapter involving a death from cancer I was literally laughing and crying and nauseated and uplifted at the same time. I don't mean alternately, I mean at the very same instant. This is pretty unusual writing. I was thinking Gen-X meets James Joyce. The characters, even some very minor characters, are quite well presented. If you want a story where the protagonist faces adversity only to take heart and overcome, you might not want this book (but maybe you should read it anyway). The characters do change, but not in pat ways, instead in the ways people really change. The protagonist is often not very likeable, yet he is human and the beauty of his existence sporadically flashes through. I am nearly as far as it gets from being a Gen-Xer but I really liked this book. The narration more than does justice to the text, shouting and crying, mumbling and enunciating when the writing called for it.

"Tragic Accident Claims the Lives of Fourteen on the Highway

Early this morning, a fatal accident occurred on the highway that claimed the lives of fourteen individuals and injured several others. The accident took place at around 5:30 a.m. when a large truck carrying a heavy load of steel beams collided with a minibus carrying thirteen passengers.

According to eyewitnesses, the driver of the minibus was trying to overtake a slower vehicle when the truck suddenly appeared from the opposite direction. Despite the efforts of both drivers to avoid a collision, the two vehicles collided head-on, causing a massive impact that led to multiple deaths and injuries.

Emergency services rushed to the scene within minutes and worked tirelessly to extract the injured passengers and transport them to nearby hospitals. However, it was reported that fourteen individuals, including the driver of the minibus, lost their lives on the spot due to the severity of their injuries.

The highway was closed for several hours as the authorities worked to clear the debris from the accident and investigate the cause of the collision. The driver of the truck has been taken into custody pending further investigation, and the authorities are urging all drivers to exercise caution on the roads to prevent further accidents.

The victims of this tragic incident have been identified as a group of factory workers who were on their way to work. The families of the deceased are in mourning, and the entire community is in shock over the loss of so many lives in a single accident.

This accident serves as a reminder of the importance of safe driving and following traffic rules to prevent such tragic incidents from occurring on our roads. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims during this difficult time.",1
"San Francisco First City in the Nation to Count Its Parking Spaces

Meters along the Embarcadero are part of the Port of San Francisco's SFPark trial. Photo: Matthew Roth

No sizable city in the country, or likely the world, has been able to say with any certainty how many parking spaces it has, public or private, until now. Over the last 18 months, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (MTA) has tallied every publicly accessible parking space within city limits, including free and metered spaces on-street and every publicly accessible garage [PDF map].

The total number of spaces, as Mayor Gavin Newsom recently announced on his Youtube site, is 441,541. Of the total, over 280,000 are on-street spaces, 25,000 of which are metered. For just the on-street spaces, that is roughly the equivalent area of Golden Gate Park.

""Most cities have very little knowledge of their parking inventory,"" said Rachel Weinberger, a planning professor at the University of

Pennsylvania and former transportation policy adviser to New York Mayor

Michael Bloomberg. Weinberger called the parking census a ""tremendous effort.""

""Without the basic knowledge [city planners] have no basis on which to make

decisions about future supply policy, about current management policy or

even about how their transportation systems are working.""

Don Shoup, planning professor at UCLA and author of the definitive book on the history of parking, The High Cost of Free Parking, was excited to hear the

news. ""San Francisco's census of parking spaces is a great achievement, and the

first of its kind anywhere,"" he said.

The release of the public parking space census coincides with the redesign of the website for SFPark, an occupancy-based parking management trial funded with a $19.8 million federal congestion mitigation grant, which among many objectives, seeks to manage the supply of parking by adjusting the cost to match demand. To put that in laymen's terms, if SFPark works well, there should be enough parking at the curb so that drivers don't have to circle the block endlessly searching for that elusive space. By gradually adjusting the price of parking up or down in the pilot areas, the city expects to create roughly one or two free spaces per block face at any time, the original purpose of parking meters when they were introduced in the 1930s.

Jay Primus, who directs the SFPark trial for the MTA, said the parking census was the first step toward a better understanding of how parking works in San Francisco, filling a void where city planners could only make rough estimates previously. ""If you can't manage what you can't count, doing a careful survey and documenting all publicly available parking was a critical first step for the MTA for how we manage parking more intelligently,"" he said.

Primus explained that his team combed through copious records to determine total public garage spaces, including the MTA's own facilities and city tax records for private facilities. For on-street unmetered spaces, he sent interns out across the city to count every fifth block, a 20 percent sample size. At every free opportunity, he sends out more interns and recently estimated they had increased their sample size to 35 percent. Time willing, he hoped to count every single space on every street.

Aside from satisfying his own penchant for good data, Primus said the data was essential if they expect the SFPark pilots to succeed in making parking more convenient for drivers and reducing traffic.

In order to expand the impact of the data, the MTA has released it to third-party developers on the Data SF Website, which the agency hopes will spur creative applications for smart phones much as software engineers have done

with the MTA's route and schedule information. With these applications, Primus expected to ""see less circling for parking, less

wasted fuel, and reduced greenhouse-gas emissions. It could help to save people

both time and money,"" he said.

""San Francisco is on the forefront of parking management,"" said Mayor

Newsom, who has championed open data through DataSF. ""By combining this data with our innovative approach to local

government open data, we continue to transform government to work better

for all of us.""

Beyond the benefits to drivers and the savings from reduced congestion, the parking census data will inform the general discussion of parking supply and development, which can become highly contentious and emotional.

Jason Henderson, a San Francisco State University Geography Professor, said San Francisco Planning Commission hearings sometimes devolve into unhelpful arguments over the supply of parking without good data to back up either side's assertions.

""It's very important to have as fact-based a conversation as possible,"" said Henderson.",0
"Some hold with the theory that the development of an embryo shows the stages of evolution. In other words, what first develops is fishlike, and then like a small mammal, and then like a lemur or ape, and then something we would recognize as human. Very early embryos have what look like little gill slits in the beginning of their development. At about four weeks, embryos have a little tail. At around six to twelve weeks, the white blood cells dissolve the tail, and the fetus develops into an average, tail-less baby... most of the time, at least. Every now and again, we get a little extra bit of baby, in the form of a vestigial tail.

Not all things that look like tails - protrusions from the tailbone - actually are what doctors consider ""true"" tails. There are a number of growths or cysts that can form right on the tip of the tailbone. Some of the more unpleasant options are large tumors, elongation of the existing vertebrae, and even parasitic twin tissue. (A parasitic twin is not a fully-formed twin, but the product of another fertilized egg that somehow became fused with the embryo and never developed into a full human being.) True tails form when the white blood cells, for whatever reason, don't absorb all the tissue that formed during embryonic development. These babies carry the marks of humans earliest ancestors.

Advertisement

Because there are only between 20 and 30 cases of ""true"" vestigial tails since the late 1800s, there is some controversy about what such a tail contains. Some early accounts say that there are sometimes extra vertebrae in such tails. No modern tails have been found to have any bone tissue. They're mostly skin with fat, connective tissue, nerves, and muscle tissue. They can be just a stub, but some babies can be born with tails 13 centimeters long. The tails aren't strictly useless inert structures. Because they have muscle tissue inside, they can actually be twitched back and forth, or even contracted into curves. These days babies don't have their tails long enough to gain a lot of muscle control over them. Removing them is a simple operation, usually done not long after birth.

What remains are questions of why these tails grow in the first place. They're rare enough that researchers aren't left with many clues. Researchers have, for the most part, ruled out family history - which throws the science of the X-Files episode I got the top image from right out the window. The tails are associated with spina bifida, a dangerous condition in which the canals of the spinal cord don't entire close before birth, but they are often present without the disorder. And for some reason they're twice in common in males as they are in females. In the end, no one knows why some babies just develop tails. (Besides, gills are much more practical.)

"Casual Arena's team has been developing Flash game browsers since 2008. Within the past year, they have specialized in game development cross-platform mobile and tablet games, studying different technologies and specializing in Cocos 2D and Unity 3D. This article highlights the differences between the two environments and compares them explaining their respective differences.

Development of 2D platform games

Most mobile and tablet game developers want to make their game available for a multitude of platforms, or at least available for iOS and Android. Of course, it is always possible to make 2 or more parallel developments using native code (Objective-C for iOS, Java for Android …), but this is not recommended. The most efficient option is to use a development environment that allows you to target multiple platforms from a single instance of game development. Here arises the first big question: What technology do I use?

There are various frameworks and technologies available to the user: Unity3D, Cocos2D, Marmalade SDK or Adobe Flash, among others. Adobe Flash is virtually only used when your application is already developed in Flash for browser use and you wish to quickly migrate to mobile. If you have a very simple application (e.g. a board game) then it is possible to use this technology, however, if your application requires more processing power (e.g pool games, games with heavy graphics or animations, etc) Flash stops being a viable option. Cocos2D is a comprehensive framework, open source and completely free.

This is the main reason for it being the most used development platform, surpassing Marmalade or Unity which are not completely free. Unity3D has been and still remains the most used development platform to develop 3D games. With new versions of Unity, which include specific functionality for the development of 2D games, it has also positioned itself in a very solid position for this type of game, making Cocos and Unity the current two options for 2D game development. From our experience, we recommend choosing one of these 2 platforms for the 2D game development. But the big question still remains:

What is the best platform for game development: Unity or Cocos?

On the internet, you are able to find many comparisons between these two platforms. When we started the development of our games we read all available data and information and used them to make our decision. The problem with these comparisons is that they were almost all very subjective. Developers who had specialized in Cocos were defending it. Those who used Unity defended Unity. There are really very few comparative expert game developers on both platforms. We have studied and developed for the 2 environments and we have an objective opinion: Unity is clearly a better platform. Actually, a more accurate answer would be: ""if you can afford it go for Unity, otherwise Cocos is a good back up"". Unity3D is a much more advanced than Cocos2D technology while Cocos2D is free and an open source. Consider the differences between them. At all times when talking about Cocos2D (or simply Cocos), we refer to Cocos2D-x, which is the platform Cocos2D extension (initially oriented for iPhone).

Cocos2D advantages versus Unity3D

Cocos2D is free, open source and more up-to-date. Unity, however, is expensive. It has a free license but is insufficient for professional game developers. The license cost is between $ 1,500 and $ 4,500 more per person (plus tax), which is a significant barrier to new developers. Cocos2D uses C++ programming language and light libraries, making it somewhat simpler than Unity. You can see the complete code for Cocos2D, edit or adapt it to your needs. If you are an expert in C ++ and do not want to pay expensive licenses for Unity, Cocos2D is the best choice. It has some very positive features, but there are not many advantages, compared with Unity. It has good physical engines, a huge amount of examples for each and every one of the features of Cocos2D, and a large community of game developers that support and improve every day, etc. But all this done by Unity too.

Unity3D advantages versus Cocos2D

Everything else. Of course, we always talk about 2D, as Coco does not support 3D software.

Design Environment

Cocos2D has no integrated design environment. The design of screens or interfaces should be done with programming, loading images and positioning them with C ++. You can, however, use external graphics editors like Cocos Studio (also free), to help you position elements on screen and configure certain objects. But this editor is much less powerful than that of Unity. The Unity editor is fully integrated. Cocos Studio, on the contrary, is not, and its operation is based on an XML file and it also generates a series of images from",0
"New Study Reveals Groundbreaking Discoveries in the Field of Genetics

Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) have made significant breakthroughs in the field of genetics. The study, published in the prestigious journal Nature, shows that certain genetic mutations may be linked to the development of cancer.

The team, led by Dr. Jane Smith, identified a specific mutation in the BRCA1 gene that is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. This discovery could have significant implications for the development of new cancer treatments.

In addition to the BRCA1 mutation, the researchers also identified a new gene, called TERT, that is involved in the development of other types of cancer, including lung and prostate cancer. The team hopes that this new knowledge will lead to the development of targeted therapies that could treat these diseases more effectively.

The study was conducted over a period of several years, using cutting-edge genetic sequencing technology. The team analyzed the DNA of thousands of patients with cancer, as",1
"Following hate attacks, mayor of Seattle delivered his 'state of the city' address at a mosque, vowing to stand for rights of all residents

Seattle Mayor Ed Murray speaks out against the travel ban at a rally in Seattle on 29 January 2017 (AFP)

The welcoming signs hung on the fence went all around the corner lot: ""We love our Muslim neighbours."" ""Thank you for enriching our community."" ""You are loved and welcome."" ""Our [Jewish] family is so happy you are here, at home.""

The mayor of Seattle was giving his ""state of the city"" address at a mosque.

'Seattleites are building community. We are spreading our arms, and opening our hearts' - Mayor Ed Murray

Looking up, one saw the architectural elegance of the Idriss Mosque, the oldest traditional-style mosque in the US west of the Mississippi river. This was the North Seattle venue that mayor Ed Murray had chosen for his annual speech, a departure from the usual locale, in downtown City Hall.

The handmade signs had gone up weeks earlier, in protest at President Donald Trump's Islamophobic policies, including the executive order banning refugees and immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries.

As the crowd trickled in, past a heavy police presence, metal detectors and a checkpoint that many said reminded them of airport security, attendees were welcomed again, this time by Hisham Farahallah, the secretary of the Idriss Mosque Board of Trustees, who thanked people for attending the event.

""By gracing us here, you have touched the hearts of Muslims across the nation,"" he said. Farahallah introduced Murray, who opened his address with a note of empowerment, vowing not to be demoralised by the bleakness of the national political scene.

'For the soul of America'

Citing racist and xenophobic precedents to the current Islamophobic climate in the country, from the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 to the Japanese internment during the second World War, Murray said, ""We are here because we are a welcoming city. We stand in solidarity with our Muslim neighbours.""

Murray was bluntly critical of Trump, explaining that ""the next four years [of Trump's Administration] will be a battle for the soul of America"". But the mayor also sounded optimistic about his city, as he observed that ""in contrast to the president's politics of polarisation, Seattleites are building community. We are spreading our arms, and opening our hearts"".

If necessary we'll go to court to get answers on @POTUS Trump's unclear immigration order & threats against cities. https://t.co/tworAwST9Q pic.twitter.com/lIa6IXBZfq — Ed Murray (@MayorEdMurray) February 21, 2017

Murray touched on many topics, from homelessness to wage disparity to police accountability and public education, but he kept coming back to what he described as a ""fundamental value of this city,"" namely ""remaining open to all"".

The decision to give the ""state of the city"" address at a mosque was announced on 13 February, after three reported Islamophobic attacks in the area.

While Seattle is seen as one of the more liberal cities in the US, it has not been totally immune to the hostile national climate. Two mosques have recently been vandalised in the Seattle area.


Residents hung welcoming signs around the mosque (Nada Elia/ MEE) The Muslim Association of Puget Sound (MAPS) in Redmond, an eastern suburb of Seattle, was attacked twice, the first time in late November 2016, and the second time in December 2016, immediately after the repairs from the first incident were completed. No suspects were arrested, even as police investigated both attacks as hate crimes.

In January 2017, the Islamic Center of the Eastside, also known as ""the Bellevue Masjid,"" just outside of Seattle, was engulfed in forty-foot flames that badly damaged the building in confirmed arson. Police arrested Isaac Wayne Wilson, a 37-year old local white man who had previous disruptive contacts with the mosque.

Sanctuary city

Seattle is one of the few ""sanctuary cities"" in the country that have openly defied Trump's anti-immigration policies. The designation ""sanctuary city"" was first used in the US in 1979, in Los Angeles, California. While the designation does not carry a legal meaning, sanctuary cities do not inquire about a resident's immigration status before dispensing services, and usually forbid their police from inquiring about a person's immigration status or share such information with immigration enforcement.

Some states, including Georgia, Arizona and Tennessee, have no sanctuary cities at all and have strict anti-immigration policies. On the other hand, the entire state of Oregon, just south of Washington, is a",0
"Former Vice President Joe Biden, 78, has officially announced his candidacy for the 2020 presidential election. Biden, who served as Vice President under Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017, is a prominent figure in the Democratic Party and has been a fierce critic of current President Donald Trump.

Biden's announcement came in the form of a video released early Thursday morning, in which he spoke about the need for unity and healing in the country. ""The core values of this nation…our standing in the world…our very democracy...everything that has made America -- America --is at stake,"" he said.

Biden has been a public figure for more than 40 years and has a long record of service in government. He served as a senator from Delaware for 36 years before becoming Vice President and has been a vocal advocate for issues such as civil rights, healthcare, and foreign policy.

However, Biden's record is not without controversy. His handling of the Anita Hill testimony during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991 has been criticized for being dismissive of Hill's allegations of sexual harassment. He has also faced criticism for his role in the 1994 crime bill that many argue has contributed to mass incarceration of black Americans.

Despite these criticisms, Biden remains a popular figure in the Democratic Party and is seen by many as a strong contender to challenge President Trump in the 2020 election. His experience in government and his ability to appeal to working-class Americans make him a formidable opponent.

Biden's announcement has already generated a lot of buzz, with many in the Democratic Party expressing their support for his candidacy. However, the road to the Democratic nomination will be a long and difficult one, with many other candidates vying for the spot.

It remains to be seen whether Biden will be able to overcome his criticisms and unite the Democratic Party behind his candidacy. However, one thing is for sure: the 2020 presidential election is shaping up to be a highly contested and historic event.",1
"Generative AI: The Future of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has come a long way since its inception in the 1950s. From chatbots to self-driving cars, AI has been revolutionizing various industries, improving efficiencies, reducing costs, and even saving lives. One of the latest advancements in AI is Generative AI, an exciting technology that has the potential to change the way we interact with computers.

Generative AI can be defined as a type of AI that involves creating new content based on a set of parameters. This includes generating images, music, text, and even entire scenes. What sets Generative AI apart from other AI technologies is that it has the ability to create new content that is unique and has never been seen before.

The technology behind Generative AI is based on a deep learning algorithm, which is essentially a computer program that can learn from data and improve over time. This algorithm is trained on a large dataset of images, text, or other content, and then uses this knowledge to generate new content that is either similar to or completely different from the original data.

One example of Generative AI in action is the creation of artwork. Artists can use Generative AI to generate new pieces of art that are completely unique and have never been seen before. This is done by feeding the AI algorithm a set of parameters, such as a particular color scheme, and the AI will then create an entirely new piece of art based on those parameters.

Another application of Generative AI is in the gaming industry. Game developers can use Generative AI to create entirely new levels and scenarios that are unique to each player. This means that players can have a completely different gaming experience every time they play the game, making it more engaging and exciting.

While Generative AI has enormous potential, it is not without its challenges. One of the biggest challenges is ensuring that the AI-generated content is ethical, unbiased, and safe. There is also the issue of copyright infringement, as Generative AI has the potential to create content that is similar to copyrighted material.

Despite these challenges, Generative AI is an exciting technology that has the potential to change the way we interact with machines. As the technology continues to improve, we can expect to see more applications of Generative AI in various industries, from healthcare to education to entertainment. It is clear that Generative AI is the future of AI, and we are only scratching the surface of what it can do.",1
"BALLABGARH: Returning home to a village near Ballabgarh in Haryana, after shopping for Eid at Jama Masjid in Delhi, a family ran into a nightmare on a local train on Thursday evening. For three and a half hours, they were abused, humiliated and assaulted by a mob of 15-20 people that passed communal remarks and accused them of carrying beef in a bag.Finally, a 19-year-old was stabbed to death and another received stab injuries. The GRP at Ballabgarh railway station failed to intervene and stop the assault.The GRP claimed on Friday to have arrested a man and detained a suspect allegedly involved in the attack.Haryana DGP B S Sandhu, however, denied that the incident was the outcome of an argument over beef. ""This was a clash between two groups which resulted in the death of one person. We have already arrested one of the accused. Police teams are investigating and others too will be arrested,"" he told TOI.The youths, from Khandoa village near Ballabgarh, had boarded an EMU at Sadar Bazar around 5.30pm. Junaid, the teenager killed by the mob, and his brothers — Mohsin, Haseem and Moeen — were carrying gifts and food for their family members and had packed them in plastic bags.Haseem (20) said that they had occupied two seats and were playing ludo when the train reached Okhla station. Around 15 to 20 people boarded the Mathura-bound train and asked them to vacate the seats. When they refused, the men abused them with communal remarks.They started calling us names and said we were unpatriotic and anti-nationals and then started hitting us. They were pointing at a packet which had food and saying that we should not be allowed to sit since we were carrying beef,"" said Haseem. They denied they were carrying beef and tried to reason with the men but they became even more aggressive.Moeen (17), Junaid's cousin, said they finally got up, somehow managed to free themselves from the mob and moved to the adjacent coach but the men followed them there, hurling abuses.""We decided to get down at Faridabad station and take another train to Ballabgarh but the men blocked our way and asked the other passengers to prevent us from leaving,"" said Mohsin (18). ""We pleaded with them to let us go but we were caught between two seats. And there was a crowd at the exit."" Scared that they would be attacked again, Mohsin called their brother Shakir, asking him to reach the station with some help.When they tried again to get off at Ballabgarh, a heated argument ensued. Shakir had responded to their call and boarded the train. Some men in the mob now pulled out knives and attacked Junaid when he tried to force his way out. ""He was pinned by four men and stabbed repeatedly till he fell unconscious.When Shakir and Moeen tried to intervene, the men caught Shakir and stabbed him in the throat, chest and hands,"" said Mohsin.He said since the train had started moving, they pulled the chain but it didn't work.Mohsin said everything was happening in plain sight of GRP personnel at Ballabgarh railway station but they refused to help them. ""To save ourselves, we called the police and the emergency response number but there was no response,"" he said.The train reached Asavati station around 9pm where they were pushed out before the train left for Mathura. They were taken to the civil hospital at Palwal by family members who had hired an ambulance from a local hospital.Junaid was declared brought dead. Shakir was referred to AIIMS Trauma Centre where he is said to be critical. Mohseen and Moeen too were admitted to the civil hospital while Haseem was discharged after treatment.The SHO of GRP at Ballabgarh police station, Surat Pal, admitted that they couldn't rescue the four youths due to the crowd at the station. ""One of them, Mohsin, called an ambulance when his brother was stabbed. Such things happen.Whenever there is a riot or fight, such things happen and people say some communal things but we can't do anything,"" said Pal quite nonchalantly. ""The fight took place over seats. We are trying to identify the other accused.""Union information and broadcasting minister M Venkaiah Naidu has condemned the incident.

"The Pennsylvania Railroad Harsimus Branch Embankment, a massive sectional retaining wall that traverses six residential blocks between Fifth and Sixth Streets, is one of the few intact relics of the legendary Pennsylvania Road-arguable the largest, wealthiest, and most influential of several railroad companies that occupied Jersey City's landscape for nearly 150 years.

Designed by James J. Ferris, a prominent civil engineer and politician in Jersey City for whom a local high school is named (Ferris also supervised the piling and pouring of the Powerhouse's vast concrete foundation), the Embankment was erected form 1901-1905 to replace an older iron and timer embankment that was deemed too low and unstable.

The Pennsylvania Railroad commissioned Ferris to design the elevated freight line on Sixth Avenue to bring seven railway lines through downtown Jersey City to Harsimus yard on the Hudson River. According to local historian John Gomez, "". . . Ferris made a conscious, successful attempt at integrating the massive structure into the surrounding residential streetscapes with as much elegance and beauty as one can give a stone bridge. The colossal granite and sandstone embankment soared segmentally - block by block, connected by steel bridges - past tenement windows, stables, warehouses and places of worship. Christened the Pennsylvania Railroad Stem Embankment, it stands as Ferris's engineering masterwork - and it turns out, his only surviving span.""


Residents of the quiet historic neighborhoods of Harsimus Cove and Hamilton Park, perfectly separated by the Embankment, had to adjust to this powerful structure. Around-the-clock steam locomotives carrying produce and live cattle cargo emerged westerly from the Pennsylvania Railroad Cut, traveled past tenement windows atop the 7-track Embankment, and led directly to the Harsimus Cove freight yards and waterfront wharves. Constructed of enormous sandstone and granite blocks, the Embankment reaches a breathtaking height of 27 feet at its western terminus near Brunswick Street. Each block-long section is 400 feet long and 100 feet wide. Gigantic plate girder bridges connected each segment but were dismantled in 1996 by Conrail and sold for scrap. Although no longer utilized, the Embankment is recognized as an engineering monument and was entered into the State Register of Historic Places in 1999.

"Machine Learning: The Future of Technology

In recent years, machine learning has gained significant attention as a transformative technology that has the potential to revolutionize various industries. From healthcare to finance to transportation, machine learning is being used to create smarter, more efficient, and more personalized solutions.

At its core, machine learning is the process of teaching computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. Essentially, it involves creating algorithms that can analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions.

One of the key benefits of machine learning is its ability to automate tasks that were previously completed by humans, allowing for greater speed and accuracy. For example, in healthcare, machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze medical images and quickly identify potential health issues, improving diagnosis times and ultimately saving lives.

In finance, machine learning is being used to detect fraudulent transactions and identify potential risks, helping to protect consumers and companies alike. And in transportation, machine learning is being used to optimize routes, reduce traffic congestion, and improve overall efficiency.

Despite its many benefits, there are also concerns about the impact that machine learning could have on jobs. As machines become more capable of performing tasks that were once done by humans, some worry that entire industries could be disrupted, leading to job loss and economic instability.

However, proponents of machine learning argue that the technology has the potential to create new jobs and industries, and that it will ultimately lead to greater prosperity and innovation.

"The International Monetary Fund repeatedly succumbed to political pressure from European governments during the eurozone debt crisis, according a damning internal report on bailout strategy that will fuel debate over whether it should continue to fund Greece.

In-house inspectors highlighted a litany of flaws in the IMF's ""uneven"" response, prompting calls for greater clarity over the fund's rescue strategy for eurozone countries.

Their assessment raises fresh questions over the failure to restructure Greek debt at the time of its first bailout in 2010. The report, released on Thursday, said key decisions had already been reached in Europe by the time the fund became involved in the rescue effort.

Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director since 2011, backed some of the inspectors' recommendations for improving internal procedures but dismissed calls from the independent evaluation office (IEO) to fortify the fund's defences against political interference.

""I support the principle that the IMF's technical analysis should remain independent,"" she said in a statement. ""However, I do not accept the premise of the recommendation, which the IEO failed to establish in its report, and thus do not see the need to develop new procedures.""

The fund's involvement in eurozone programmes had been a ""qualified success"" in the face of unprecedented systemic challenge, Ms Lagarde said.

Nonetheless, the report is likely to fan suspicions of some emerging market IMF shareholders and some of its staff that it repeatedly bent its own rules to help out the eurozone.

""It highlights the concerns of many — both inside and outside the fund – that the fund's treatment of developing and emerging market economies is quite different from its treatment of advanced economies,"" said Eswar Prasad, economics professor at Cornell University and former IMF official.

""Political factors seemed to play a bigger role than pure technical considerations in matters involving advanced economies.""

The inspectors said the troika arrangement — in which the IMF worked alongside the European Commission and European Central Bank — potentially subjected the technical judgment of IMF staff ""to political pressure"" from an early stage.

""The European Commission, in the area of emergency crisis lending, acted as the agent of the eurogroup, which in turn represented member states and decided whether to provide assistance.

""Interviews and some internal documents suggest that political feasibility in creditor countries was an important consideration for [European Commission] staff and that IMF staff occasionally felt pressured to accept a less-than-ideal outcome.

The inspectors said the IMF executive board, responsible for the fund's day-to-day business, was in the dark on sensitive policy questions for Greece and Ireland, which also received a bailout in 2010.

Some executive board members, who usually meet several times each week, learned more from the press throughout the crisis period than from informal board meetings.

The board approved the first Greek deal in May 2010 ""without seeking pre-emptive debt restructuring, even though its sovereign debt was not deemed sustainable with a high probability"".

""The risk of contagion was an important consideration in coming to this decision. The IMF's policy on exceptional access to fund resources, which mandates early board involvement, was followed only in a perfunctory manner.""

The fiscal troubles of Greece remain unresolved, fanning concern about regional instability at a time of upheaval in Turkey. In recent days the US has pressed the country's European creditors to allow a debt restructuring to restore order in its finances.

The inspectors, led by Japanese academic Shinji Takagi, found the IMF had considered the prospect of lending to a eurozone country to be unlikely and had never set out how such programmes might be designed.

The report said IMF managers had moved some time before the Greek rescue to explore contingencies. Still, the work of special task forces ""was so secret that few within the institution knew of their existence, let alone the content of their deliberations"".

Ms Lagarde said IMF-backed programmes bought time to build firewalls, prevented the crisis from spreading, and restored growth and market access in Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus.

""Greece, however, was unique: while initial economic targets proved overly ambitious, the programme was beset by recurrent political crises, pushback from vested interests, and severe implementation problems that led to a much deeper-than-expected output contraction.

""On the other hand, Greece undertook enormous adjustment with unprecedented assistance from its international partners. This enabled Greece to remain a member of the euro area — a key goal for Greece and the euro area members.""

New Street Station has been at the centre of public attention in recent times, with its extensive redevelopment works in full swing . However, at the heart of it, and often overlooked, sits the Grade II listed signal box on Navigation Street, which houses the centre of all rail operations of the station.

The corrugated concrete Brutalist structure may polarise public opinion, but is actually home of one of the city's most vital and intense infrastructure systems, serving the busiest rail interchange in the UK.

Designed by Bicknell & Hamilton and W.R. Healey and completed in 1965, the unapologetically bunker-like structure is an honest expression of its utilitarian function. Standing five storeys high above track level, the building gives no clue of the hive of activity that exists within its four walls.

The technology inside is of the same era as the exterior façade and was revolutionary for its time. The Relay Room sits just above street level and houses enormous banks of algorithmic electronic relays, known as Wespacs, which are programmed to calculate legal routes for the trains to take.

To maintain these systems, Network Rail engineers have to retain specialist knowledge of technology that is decades old. The long aisles of Wespacs are lit by incessantly flashing green and red lights and the extraordinary sound of thousands of relays clicking fills the room.

The top floor, or the Operational Floor, is reminiscent of the lair of a 1960s Bond villain. From their elevated perch a dedicated team operates 24/7, 365 days a year, and has done since the Signal Box opened.

Stood in front of a gigantic processing unit, which maps out the rail network with intertwining lines of LED lights and buttons, the team plan the routes for every train between Birmingham International and Wolverhampton.

Love it or hate it, signal boxes are soon to be a thing of the past. Over the next decade the signal boxes of the UK will be consolidated into centralised control centres where a single computer will control vast areas of track, a far cry from the ticking behemoths of the New Street Signal Box.

Thankfully, due its listed status, the humble concrete box on Navigation Street will remain a bastion for the romance of the railways, if only in spirit.

"Scientists Make Groundbreaking Discovery in Cancer Research

A team of scientists has made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of cancer research, offering hope for millions of people around the world. The researchers found that a new drug can selectively target cancerous cells while leaving healthy cells unaffected.

The drug, called ONC201, works by inhibiting a protein called Akt, which is overactive in many types of cancer. By inhibiting Akt, the drug causes cancer cells to undergo a process called apoptosis, or programmed cell death.

The team, led by Dr. John Doerr at the University of California, tested the drug on human cancer cells in the lab and found that it was highly effective at killing cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed. The drug was then tested on mice with human tumors, and the results were equally promising.

The researchers are now planning to move forward with clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy of the drug in humans. If successful, this could lead to a major breakthrough in",1
"Fitness fanatics should reach for the mustard and NOT spinach if they want to look like Popeye


Fitness fanatics looking to build muscle should consider reaching for the mustard, a study has found.


The steroid homobrassinolide, found in the mustard plant, increases muscle mass, the size of muscle fibres and appetite, research suggests.


In addition, the effect when tested on rats was similar to anabolic steroids, which promote the growth of muscle and which are used illegally by athletes to improve performance.


Spinach is out, and mustard is in as one way to build your muscle strength, according to a new study


A team of scientists exposed rat muscle cells to different amounts of homobrassinolide and measured protein synthesis – the process in which cells build proteins – in cell culture. The result was increased production – vital for building muscles – and decreased breakdown of protein in the cells.

Researcher Dr Slavo Komarnytsky, at North Carolina State University, said: 'We hope that one day brassinosteroids may provide an effective, natural, and safe alternative for age and disease-associated muscle loss, or be used to improve endurance and physical performance.'

'Because some plants we eat contain these compounds, like mustards, in the future we may be able to breed or engineer these plants for higher brassinosteroid content, thus producing functional foods that can treat or prevent diseases and increase physical performance.'

Old school: Cartoon character Popeye missed a trick on not including mustard in his strength-diet

Dr Gerald Weissmann, editor of the FASEB Journal, in which the study was published, added: ' The temptation is to see this discovery as another quick fix to help you go from fat to fit, and to a very small degree, this may be true.

'This study identifies an important drug target for a wide range of conditions that cause muscle wasting.'


During the research healthy rats then received an oral dose of homobrassinolide daily for 24 days and changes in body weight, food consumption and body consumption were measured.


Rats receiving the steroid gained more weight and slightly increased their food intake.


Body composition was measured and showed increased lean body mass in the animals treated.


This study was repeated in rats fed high protein diets and similar results were seen.",0
"Machine Learning: The Future of Technology

Machine learning, the revolutionary technology that enables computer systems to learn and improve from experience, is poised to transform the world as we know it.

"In recent years, the educational system in Finland has gained a lot of attention for its innovative and effective approach. Finland's education system has consistently ranked among the top in the world, with remarkable results in terms of student performance and educational equality. The system is widely recognized for its emphasis on creativity, individualized learning, and high-quality teacher training.

One of the key features of the Finnish education system is the focus on equal opportunities and accessibility. Education is free for all students from primary to secondary levels, and there is no tracking or streaming based on students' abilities or socioeconomic backgrounds. Additionally, schools in Finland are located within walking or biking distance from homes, reducing the need for long commutes and ensuring that all students have access to education regardless of their location.

Another highlight of the Finnish education system is the emphasis on early childhood education. Early education is seen as a crucial foundation for later success, with children as young as six months old attending daycare and receiving age-appropriate education. This ensures that all children are given the best possible start in life and that they are ready for school when the time comes.

Perhaps the most significant factor contributing to Finland's educational success is the high quality of teacher training and support. Teachers in Finland are highly educated and are required to complete a master's degree before they can teach in primary or secondary schools. This ensures that teachers have a deep understanding of their subject matter and can provide students with a high-quality education. Additionally, teachers in Finland are given significant autonomy in their classrooms, allowing them to tailor their teaching methods to the needs of individual students.

In conclusion, the Finnish education system is one of the most successful in the world, and for good reason.

"Washington D.C. - In the midst of national tension and political turmoil, one politician stands out as a beacon of hope for many Americans. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has become a prominent figure in the Democratic party, championing progressive policies and advocating for marginalized communities.

Born and raised in the Bronx, Ocasio-Cortez's upbringing has heavily influenced her political beliefs. After graduating from Boston University with degrees in economics and international relations, she worked as a community organizer and waitress before running for Congress in 2018. Her stunning upset victory over 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley made her the youngest woman ever elected to Congress at just 29 years old.

Since then, Ocasio-Cortez has been a vocal advocate for policies such as the Green New Deal, which aims to combat climate change and create jobs through investment in renewable energy. She has also been a fierce critic of income inequality and has called for a higher minimum wage and stronger labor protections.

While her progressive beliefs have earned her a loyal following, they have also made her a lightning rod for criticism from conservative politicians and media figures. She has been the subject of numerous attacks, including baseless claims that she is a ""socialist"" and even calls for her to be deported.

However, Ocasio-Cortez has remained steadfast in her beliefs and unapologetic in her advocacy for social and economic justice. Her willingness to take on powerful interests and challenge the status quo has made her a hero to many who feel disillusioned by the current political system.

"Scientists Make Breakthrough Discovery in Cancer Research

In a groundbreaking development, scientists have discovered a new way to fight cancer. The research team, led by Dr. Anna Lee, found that a specific protein in the body plays a crucial role in the growth and spread of cancer cells.

""This is a major breakthrough in our understanding of cancer biology,"" said Dr. Lee. ""We believe that this discovery could eventually lead to new and more effective treatments for cancer patients.""

The protein, called RAS, is found in all cells in the body and is involved in regulating cell growth and division. However, when RAS becomes mutated, it can cause cells to divide and grow uncontrollably, leading to the development of cancer.

The research team found that by targeting RAS with a specific drug, they were able to slow down the growth and spread of cancer cells in animal models. This new approach could potentially be used to develop targeted therapies for cancer patients with RAS mutations.

""This discovery is particularly exciting because",1
"A Los Angeles jury awarded a woman a $417 million verdict yesterday. The jury found that Johnson & Johnson failed to adequately warn users of the cancer risks of the talc in its baby powder.

The jury's 9-3 vote to hold J&J liable for not warning Eva Echeverria about cancer risks is a huge blow to the company, which is facing thousands of such claims across the country. The verdict consists of $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages, according to Reuters.

No clear link connects talcum powder to ovarian cancer. Some case-control studies, based on asking women who have ovarian cancer about their history, have found a slightly increased risk. But as the American Cancer Society notes, those kinds of studies can be biased because they rely on a person's memory of talc use years after the fact.

Two prospective cohort studies, which don't suffer from that type of hindsight bias, found no increased risk.

It is plausible, scientists say, that talcum powder applied to the genitals could travel through the vagina and into the ovaries, causing inflammation. Since inflammation increases the risk of cancer, it's possible that talc causes cancer. But, again, the two most rigorous studies didn't find any link.

Harvard University epidemiologist Daniel Cramer has published several studies, beginning in 1982, that found a link between talc exposure and increased ovarian cancer. Cramer worked as a paid consultant for the plaintiff's lawyers in a St. Louis case that resulted in a $72 million verdict against J&J.

Talc, a clay mineral found around the world, is often used in powder form as a moisture-absorbing product and sold as talcum powder. ""Baby powder"" is a marketing term for cosmetic products that can be made from corn starch, talc, and other powders. Earlier versions of talcum powder sometimes contained asbestos, a known cancer-causing agent. But asbestos hasn't been present in talcum powder in the US since the 1970s.

Landmark verdict

The Echeverria case was the first California talc case to go to trial, and the jury's massive figure will set a new standard for the many talc cases to come. Hundreds more are in earlier stages of litigation in California alone.

The 63-year-old woman used J&J's products for decades before she developed terminal ovarian cancer. Echeverria's lawyers said that J&J encouraged women to use the product, despite knowing about studies linking talc and ovarian cancer.

The case was the first state trial outside of Missouri, Bloomberg reported. J&J has faced five Missouri trials over the last two years and lost four of them. The company has been hit with verdicts as high as $110 million.

""J&J needs to see they not only have verdicts against them in St. Louis; they now also have them in Los Angeles,"" Mark Robinson, Echeverria's lawyer, told Bloomberg. ""There's a problem all over the country with women using talcum powder on a daily basis for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.""

J&J has said they will appeal the case.

""We are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder,"" a J&J spokesperson told Bloomberg. ""We are preparing for additional trials in the US, and we will continue to defend the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder.""

Bloomberg, which tallies large verdicts and settlements, says that yesterday's jury verdict was the third-largest of 2017. The largest (for $500 million) was ZeniMax's February win against Facebook over its virtual reality headset.",0
"Dexter Morgan is a fictional character and the antihero of a series of novels by Jeff Lindsay. In 2006, the first novel was adapted into Showtime's original TV series DEXTER. Its companion web series Dexter Early Cuts aired in the years 2009, 2010, and 2012.

List of Novels

Television Series

There are eight seasons of DEXTER, which originally aired from 2006 to 2013. In the TV series, Dexter is a forensic blood spatter analyst who works for the fictitious Miami Metro Police Department. In his spare time, he is a vigilante serial killer who targets other murderers who have evaded the justice system. He follows a code of ethics taught to him in childhood by his adoptive father, Harry, referred to as ""The Code"" or ""The Code of Harry."" It hinges on certain principles, which include: Dexter can only kill people after finding conclusive evidence that they are guilty of murder, and he must not get caught.

Adaptation from Novels

Season 1 is largely based on the first novel, Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), but the following seasons veered away from the rest of the book series. In the television program, Dexter was played by Michael C. Hall, who won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series or Drama in 2009. He was also portrayed as a youth by Devon Graye, Dominic Janes, Nicholas Vigneau, and Maxwell Huckabee.

There are notable distinctions between many of the characters in the Dexter novels and on Showtime's television adaptation. As can happen with books that are adapted into movies or TV series, changes were made that influenced the course of the storyline. These changes included the major characters' attributes, deaths (or introductions), along with miscellaneous information (such as their names, ages, addresses, relationships, etc.).

Dexter Morgan - Dexter's personality differs quite a bit between the TV series and the novels. In the TV series, almost everyone who learns of his secret ultimately dies. Notable exceptions are Lumen Pierce and Hannah McKay.

Debra Morgan - She has relationships with characters nonexistent in the novels. In the TV series, Debra Morgan eventually dies while, in the novels, Deborah remains very much alive.

Maria LaGuerta - Instead of being called Migdia, the creators of the show decided to name her Maria. On television, she is often seen as harsh but, at times, will reveal that she has a heart despite her unrelenting political game.

"I've always had a soft spot for Heimerdinger. He was the second champion I played (behind a very confusing game as Twitch), and the first champion I considered my ""main"". Call it a soft-spot for small, intelligent characters, but something about the little afro-headed genius clicked. Turrets that farmed for me? Instantly-hitting rockets? You had me at substandard intelligence!

Of course, as I continued my time in the League of Legends, the general stigma that followed my Heimerdinger obsession was made readily apparent; people, to this day, hate having the smartest Yordle ever on their team. His pick-rate is the fourth worst currently, and his win-rate fluctuates from average to 'meh'. Anyone playing him is instantly a ""troll"" or a ""noob"", and after a couple months of playing him, I was forced into different roles and champions.

But why is Heimerdinger so despised, left amongst the Lost Legends never to be seen again? He's had a rough balance history, and hasn't been touched recently, but does that mean he's as bad as his reputation? And with the sweeping changes of the ever-approaching Season Three, will he ever be considered pick-worthy?

There is potential in Heimerdinger; I noticed that in Season 2. The one match I had as Heimerdinger had more damage than my other, multiple-game AP mids. His turrets produce some of the most steady AP damage outside of Teemo, and his rockets have 285 base damage at max level. His grenade is potent as well, but landing it is tricky. Overall, the main problem with Heimerdinger is not that his damage is low, but merely inconsistent.

Getting Heimerdinger's abilities to work in your favor is tedious, especially during the laning phase. His turrets generally shoot at anything that seems least threatening, his grenade moves slower than electricity seemingly should, and timing his rockets to hit just before that third minion is able to block them can drive any Summoner to madness. Without any priority to his spell targets beyond distance and luck, Heimerdinger's damage requires a surprising amount of patience and skill for a champion who seems so simple. A lot of this is removed in team fights; as long as their aren't enemy minions/pets to worry about, the damage from his rockets alone is brutal.

Recently, I ran a sample blind-pick game to get some baring on whether the recent changes have made him any more viable. While I haven't had much luck picking him again (people tend to dodge games when they see Heimer), I will explain my thought process and build below.

Role: AP Carry, Mid Lane

Runes:


With my runes, I focus on getting as much penetration as possible, with mana regen and move speed for lane sustain and survival. The penetration Quintessence is optional, as an extra move speed rune in its place is just as helpful.

Masteries:


Fairly standard masteries. Defense or Utility really depends on play style, but I can see both working.

Summoner Spells:

Flash, Ignite, Teleport

Flash is essential, as it provides you with an easy escape (which Heimer is lacking). Secondary choice is more personal. Ignite is always nice, but Heimerdinger is usually not putting himself in range to use it. Teleport is the best alternative, but any can be used to match your play style.

Build Order:

Dorans Ring -> Haunting Guise -> Sorcerer's Shoes -> Void Staff -> Rabadon's Deathcap

Options:

Liandry's Torment, Rylai's Crystal Scepter, Athene's Unholy Grail, Zhonya's Hourglass

With my items, I focus on getting as much magic penetration as possible, as quickly as possible. Heimerdinger's spells have high base damage with average ratios. I don't recommend instantly upgrading Haunting Guise, as it has the same penetration as Liandry's and the money is best spent elsewhere. After Void Staff, you've hit max penetration, and can start building damage. Rabadon's is essential, but after that the choice is more based on how team fights are going. Rylai's gets fully proc'd with each rocket, Zhonya's is great if you keep getting focused down in fights, and Athene's is a good solution for any mana problems.

Laning:

Heimerdinger is a defensive laner, and relies mostly on the poke from his rockets to keep his lane opponent at bay. Leveling skills generally goes in this order:

Rockets, Turrets, Grenade.

Rockets offer the best controllable damage, so I tend to level them first.

"Scientists Discover New Method for Converting Carbon Dioxide into Fuel

In a major breakthrough for environmental science, a team of researchers has discovered a new method for converting carbon dioxide into fuel. The discovery could help to reduce the world's dependence on fossil fuels and slow the progress of climate change.

The team, led by Dr. Jane Lee of the University of California, Berkeley, used a process called ""electrochemical reduction"" to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into a liquid fuel that can be used for transportation. The process involves applying an electric current to a solution containing CO2 and water, which triggers a chemical reaction that produces a fuel called formic acid.

Formic acid is a sustainable fuel that can be used in fuel cells to power electric vehicles. It can also be used as a building block for other chemicals and materials. Unlike fossil fuels, formic acid does not release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when burned, making it a much cleaner alternative.

The team tested their method using a",1
"Mathematics is often viewed by many as a daunting subject, one that is filled with complicated formulas and abstract concepts. However, it is an essential subject, with applications in almost every aspect of our lives. From calculating the distance between planets to designing complex systems, mathematics plays an essential role in modern society.

One of the most exciting aspects of mathematics is the application of theories to solve practical problems. For example, the use of calculus in engineering is crucial in designing structures and systems that can withstand extreme conditions. Similarly, statistics is essential in making sense of vast amounts of data and making informed decisions based on that data.

However, the importance of mathematics extends beyond practical applications. It is also important for intellectual development and problem-solving skills. The ability to think logically and systematically is a valuable skill that can be applied in any field or occupation.

Furthermore, mathematics has a rich history that dates back thousands of years.

"Generative AI: A Game Changer for the Future of Technology

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a buzzword in the technology industry for decades, and with good reason. The advent of AI has brought about dramatic changes to the way we live, work, and interact with each other. One of the most exciting developments in AI is generative AI, a technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we create and innovate.

Generative AI is a subset of machine learning, a field of AI that allows machines to learn from data. Unlike traditional machine learning algorithms that rely on large sets of data, generative AI uses a smaller dataset to generate new, never-before-seen content. This content can range from images and videos to music and text.

The most significant advantage of generative AI is its ability to create new content that is not based on existing data. This means that it can generate entirely new ideas, designs, and concepts that humans may not have thought of before. This makes it an invaluable tool for industries such as fashion, art, and entertainment, where creativity is vital.

Another benefit of generative AI is its ability to learn from feedback. As it generates content, it receives feedback from users, which it can use to improve its output. This feedback loop allows generative AI to continually improve its performance, leading to better results over time.

NEW ORLEANS (WGNO) - In New Orleans, random acts of kindness have been taken to a new level in an effort to prove that good will triumph over evil.

Good Samaritan and New Orleans business owner Frank Scurlock says he's just trying to remind people that goodness will prevail if you let it.

He hired a Kentucky-based skywriter, Nathan Hammond, to spread some joy over the city for 10 days.

""The weather is gorgeous. This is what we dream for. Bluebird skies, cool weather,"" says Hammond.

Hammond is one of only a handful of professional skywriters in existence. He has a conference call with Scurlock twice a day, to determine the content and location for the day's positive messages in the sky.

""It's crazy actually, my phones are blowing up. Social media is blowing up. The media is blowing up. It's been phenomenal,"" says Scurlock.

For Hammond, this is a much bigger job than usual.

""Normally we do 'Will you marry me?' or 'Eat at Joe's,' so when he said we want to do 10 days and three messages a day, it took us off guard a little bit,"" says Hammond.

Since skywriters are allowed to turn off their radios for better concentration, Hammond says he works directly with Air Traffic Control when he's flying.

""They still see me on the radar, but I don't have any distractions coming in, no noise coming in through the headset or anything like that, so that I can focus strictly on what I'm doing and make sure that the message is where it needs to be, when it needs to be, pointed in the right direction and spelled correctly,"" he adds.

What's the cost of all this philanthropic flying? So far, the bill is between $20,000 and $25,000. The last flight is scheduled for Sunday. Hammond says he'll also be decorating the sky over Baton Rouge sometime soon.

Charla Miller works with the man behind the messages and she says her boss has even bigger plans.

""He has a big concern for the violence that has been going on locally and nationally, and this has both a local scope and hopefully a future national scope for him too with the skywriting,"" says Miller.

A fatal accident occurred today on Main Street, leaving one person dead and several others injured. According to eyewitnesses, the accident occurred around 10:30 am when a speeding car lost control and hit a group of pedestrians waiting to cross the street.

The victim, identified as 52-year-old John Smith, was a local resident who was on his way to work. He was pronounced dead on the scene. The driver, who was also injured, was rushed to the hospital for treatment. The severity of his injuries is unknown at this time.

Several eyewitnesses who were at the scene expressed shock and disbelief at the tragic accident. ""It all happened so fast,"" said one witness. ""I heard a loud screeching sound, and then people screaming. The next thing I knew, there were people lying on the ground.""

Police and emergency services quickly arrived at the scene and cordoned off the area. The injured pedestrians were treated on the spot and then taken to nearby hospitals for further treatment. The police have launched an investigation into the incident, and the driver's blood samples have been taken for testing.

The Mayor's office has released a statement expressing condolences to the victim's family and friends and urging drivers to exercise caution on the roads. ""We are deeply saddened by this tragic accident and offer our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the victim. We urge all drivers to obey traffic rules and exercise caution on the roads.""

"Tragic Accident Claims Two Lives on Highway 101

A horrific accident on Highway 101 claimed the lives of two individuals on Tuesday evening. The accident involved a passenger sedan and a tractor-trailer, and it occurred at approximately 7:30 pm near the exit for Willow Road.

According to eyewitnesses, the passenger sedan was traveling southbound on Highway 101 when it suddenly veered across the median and collided with the tractor-trailer in the northbound lanes. The impact of the collision was so severe that both vehicles were severely damaged, and debris was strewn across the highway.

Emergency services were quickly dispatched to the scene, and both drivers were extricated from their vehicles. However, despite the best efforts of the emergency responders, both drivers were pronounced dead at the scene of the accident.

The cause of the accident is still under investigation, and it is unclear at this time what caused the driver of the passenger sedan to cross the median. The identity of the drivers has not yet been released pending the notification of their families.

The accident resulted in the closure of both north and southbound lanes of Highway 101 for several hours while the wreckage was cleared and the investigation was conducted. Traffic was diverted onto local roads, causing significant delays for commuters.

This tragic accident serves as a reminder of the importance of safe driving practices and the need for vigilance when operating a vehicle. We extend our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims during this difficult time.",1
"We already had a pretty good idea what to expect from BMW Motorrad at the 2016 EIMCA show, but it is good to see that the Germans can still surprise us – and what a surprise it was, indeed.

Sort of a ""one more thing"" moment in Milan, the BMW HP4 Race was teased to the assembled EICMA press – giving us a look at their ultra-premium version of the BMW S1000RR Superbike, and it drips in carbon fiber.

Of course what really sets the BMW HP4 Race apart is the fact that it uses a twin-spar carbon fiber frame, making it, and the recently debuted Ducati 1299 Superleggera, the only production motorcycles with such a feature.

Details beyond what we can see are very scarce from BMW Motorrad, though we do know that we can expect the BMW HP4 Race to debut in the second-half of 2017. The name suggests that the bike might not be homologated for street use, but time will have to tell on that.

From looking at the concept bike in Milan, we can see that the carbon fiber chassis is joined by carbon fiber wheels and carbon fiber fairings. As such, we would expect a 20 lbs weight reduction, or more, from HP4 Race compared to the older HP4 model.

That should make the BMW HP4 Race one of the lightest superbikes on the market, though that ultimate title will likely stay with its Italian counterpart.

Other items we see are an Akrapovic exhaust, Brembo brakes, and Öhlins FGR forks (likely paired with an Öhlins TTX rear shock) – all standard items for a track-focused machine that spares no expense.

You have to feel bad for BMW in a way though, debuting such a bombshell of a bike, just a day after Ducati dropped the 1299 Superleggera, sort of steals the thunder from such a spectacular machine. Still, the S1000RR is one of the best superbikes on the market, and it only got better in its HP4 trim.

As such, we expect great things from the BMW HP4 Race once it officially debuts. The question is though, how many will be built, and how much will they cost? We need to start finding new homes for some of our organs…

"There's no way around the fact that Marvel's Netflix Iron Fist had the highest hill to climb of the four Defenders . Daredevil was easy enough to sell as a traditional superhero, while Jessica Jones built off that credibility to bring us a different type of hero , whose cynical tone and stellar cast created something wholly unique. Luke Cage got to pivot into a world we'd already explored, adding flavors of hip-hop and Blaxploitation to timely and vital issues. Iron Fist has always been the outlier here, and it's no surprise that reports claimed Marvel was uncertain how to angle its interpretation , especially in light of the racial controversy swirling around Finn Jones ' casting as Danny Rand .

As a lead-in to The Defenders , the hope was that Iron Fist could lean into its more mystical elements, but the end result feels much closer to a spaced-out retelling of Batman Begins , minus the fact that Jones' Danny Rand lacks any of the self-awareness or purpose of Bruce Wayne, and, frankly, comes across as a petulant brat most of the time. Without Alfred to ground him, and no urgent mission to focus the early episodes, we wind up with three shows worth of Danny wandering into people's personal space, presumptuously expecting their embrace, and attempting to reclaim a corporate majority shareholder position that – by his own admission! – he has no idea what to do with.

Danny Rand is Marvel's Dumb, Idiot Man-Child Batman .

Marvel / Netflix

It's not Finn Jones' fault, and I don't relish the thought of a young actor being made the poster child for a racially-charged comic's history, but the whole of Iron Fist feels notably underwritten when viewed through that lens. Danny is painted as a child trapped by the surreal trauma of his past. Think Big without Tom Hanks ' charisma, so that Danny registers more immature than enlightened, more arrogant than experienced (never thought I'd use the phrase ""chi-splaining""). His occasional flashes of charm never balance the disruption he brings everyone around him.

Along for this rampage through common sense are Jessica Stroup and Tom Pelphrey as Danny's childhood companions Joy and Ward Meachum, plus Jones' fellow Game of Thrones alum Jessica Henwick as Colleen Wing , a karate teacher that winds up becoming Danny's reluctant partner. The former two seem equally under-thought, vacillating between pseudo-antagonists and sympathetic sounding boards. Dancing around all of this is David Wenham's shadowy patriarch Harold Meachum , who is given nothing to do but ponder Danny's return from afar, remind a beleaguered Ward to do his bidding and – I kid you not – cultivate a borderline dominant/submissive relationship with his personal assistant.

Henwick's Colleen Wing feels like the most fully-realized character, as someone who matches Danny's world for both wits and fists. Like Danny, Colleen only truly comes alive in the middle of a fight, but unlike our immortal Iron Fist, she displays an interior life beyond the ring. It's a rich supporting performance, albeit one Iron Fist initially overlooks to spend three episodes on Danny convincing others he's actually who he claims.

Marvel / Netflix

You may have noticed that I've spent five paragraphs without much mention of the actual fights, which could have redeemed a lot of Iron Fist 's flaws. It won't take a student of martial-arts cinema to recognize that most of the show's fight choreography as a rehash of Marvel's Daredevil with a little more kung fu style. There was a real opportunity here to up the visual ante before Defenders , and while occasional moments keep things lively, like the requisite hallway fight turning into a split-screen elevator battle, truly dynamic sequences are few and far between.

The honest truth is that Iron Fist needed to be so much weirder than it actually is, akin to how Doctor Strange essentially re-told the Iron Man story with enough out-there visuals and eccentric supporting characters to paper over any shortcomings. Iron Fist starts to show signs of life in its sixth episode (a very video game-like, RZA-directed outing ), but the slog in getting there is too great an ask, especially when the vast majority of the principal characters feel so spectacularly underdeveloped.

This is an origin story of a man stranded in the mystical world, mastering martial arts from characters with names like ""Lei-Kung the Thunderer,"" and fighting an actual freaking dragon named ""Shou-Lao the Undying."" Why are we stuck with Batman Begins by way of Suits ?

AND ANOTHER THING …

If it wasn't already apparent, don't expect anything terribly memorable from the opening credits, visually or musically.

I am deeply amused by a character who suddenly rationalizes M+Ms as the solution to her problem, and apparently keeps bags of them behind her desk for just such an occasion.

"The educational system of Finland has been widely regarded as one of the best in Europe, and for good reason. The country's approach to education has been praised for its emphasis on individual learning, teacher autonomy, and comprehensive early childhood education.

One of the most notable aspects of Finland's educational system is the concept of ""peruskoulu,"" which translates to comprehensive school. This system combines primary and secondary education into a single nine-year program, aiming to provide equal opportunities for all students regardless of socio-economic status.

Another key aspect of the Finnish educational system is the emphasis on early childhood education. Finnish children have access to high-quality preschool education, and it is not uncommon for children as young as six months old to attend daycare. This early investment in education has been shown to lead to better academic performance later in life.

Perhaps most importantly, Finland's educational system places a high value on teacher autonomy and professionalism. Finnish teachers are highly trained and respected, and they are given a great deal of freedom in designing their own curricula and teaching methods. This approach is seen as crucial to fostering a culture of lifelong learning and curiosity.

Overall, the Finnish educational system is a shining example of what can be achieved when education is seen as a fundamental human right. Through a commitment to individualized learning, early childhood education, and teacher professionalism, Finland has built a system that consistently produces highly skilled and engaged citizens.",1
"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has been a source of concern for the international community for years. The war, which began in 2014, has claimed the lives of thousands of people and has displaced millions from their homes.

The conflict erupted after pro-Russian separatists seized control of Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine in the aftermath of Ukraine's pro-Western revolution. Russia has denied any involvement in the conflict, despite evidence to the contrary.

The fighting has been brutal, with both sides accused of committing war crimes. Civilians have been caught in the crossfire, with reports of indiscriminate shelling and attacks on civilian targets.

As the conflict drags on, the humanitarian situation in Ukraine continues to deteriorate. The UN estimates that over 3.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, with many lacking access to basic necessities such as food, water, and healthcare.

Efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict have so far been unsuccessful. A ceasefire agreement was signed in 2015, but it has been repeatedly violated. Diplomatic efforts have also been hampered by the ongoing tensions between Ukraine and Russia.

The international community has called for an end to the violence and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The EU and US have imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its annexation of Crimea and its alleged support for separatist rebels.

The war in Ukraine is a tragic reminder of the devastating impact of conflict on civilians. The international community must continue to work towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict and provide support to those affected by the fighting.",1

"CASTELNUOVO DI PORTO, Italy (AP) — Pope Francis washed and kissed the feet of Muslim, Orthodox, Hindu and Catholic refugees Thursday, declaring them children of the same God, in a gesture of welcome and brotherhood at a time when anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment has spiked following the Brussels attacks.

Francis denounced the carnage as a ""gesture of war"" carried out by blood-thirsty people beholden to the weapons industry during an Easter Week Mass with asylum seekers at the shelter in Castelnuovo di Porto, outside Rome.

The Holy Thursday rite re-enacts the foot-washing ritual Jesus performed on his apostles before being crucified, and is meant as a gesture of service.

Francis contrasted that gesture with the ""gesture of destruction"" carried out by the Brussels attackers, saying they wanted to destroy the brotherhood of humanity represented by the migrants.

""We have different cultures and religions, but we are brothers and we want to live in peace,"" Francis said in his homily, delivered off-the-cuff in the windy courtyard of the center.

Several of the migrants then wept as Francis knelt before them, poured holy water from a brass pitcher over their feet, wiped them clean and kissed them.

Francis was greeted with a banner reading ""Welcome"" in a variety of languages as he walked down a makeshift aisle to celebrate the outdoor Mass. But only a fraction of the 892 asylum seekers living at the shelter attended, and many of the seats were left empty. Those who came out, though, received a personal greeting: At the end of the Mass, Francis greeted each refugee, one by one, posing for selfies and accepting notes as he moved down the rows.

Vatican rules had long called for only men to participate in the ritual, and past popes and many priests traditionally performed it on 12 Catholic men, recalling Jesus' 12 apostles and further cementing the doctrine of an all-male priesthood.

Francis shocked many Catholics within weeks of his 2013 election by performing the ritual on women and Muslims at a juvenile detention center. After years of violating the rules outright, Francis in January changed the regulations to explicitly allow women and girls to participate.

The Vatican said Thursday that four women and eight men took part. The women included an Italian Catholic who works at the center and three Eritrean Coptic Christian migrants. The men included four Catholics from Nigeria, three Muslims from Mali, Syria and Pakistan and a Hindu man from India.

The Vatican's new norms said anyone from the ""people of God"" could be chosen to participate in the ceremony. While the phrase ""people of God"" usually refers to baptized Christians, the decree also said that pastors should instruct ""both the chosen faithful and others so that they may participate in the rite consciously, actively and fruitfully,"" suggesting that the rite could be open to non-Catholics as well.

Francis seemed to define ""people of God"" as open-ended.

""All of us, together: Muslims, Hindi, Catholics, Copts, Evangelicals. But brothers, children of the same God,"" he said. ""We want to live in peace, integrated.""

"""Magic mushrooms,"" the recreational hallucinogen long associated with music festivals and hippies, may also one day prove to have a powerful pharmaceutical effect for people with treatment-resistant depression.

In a small pilot study at the Center for Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, more than half of participants who took psilocybin, the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms, showed a marked improvement in their depression symptoms while also demonstrating the compound's safety in a supervised setting.

This is the first clinical trial to use the active chemical compound in so-called ""magic mushrooms"" to treat major depression. If the findings are confirmed in larger studies, it could mean a change in the way we treat depression symptoms in those who don't respond to therapy and traditional medications, like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

What we knew before:

Mushrooms from the genus Psilocybe contain psilocybin, which the human body breaks down into a substance called psilocin. This psychedelic substance then crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds to a specific serotonin receptor known as 5-HT2A, creating a profound alteration of consciousness that has been described as a mystical event, a spiritual journey or simply a ""trip."" Psychedelic compounds in LSD, ayahuasca and mescaline bind to this same receptor.

Human beings have been consuming psychedelic mushrooms for thousands of years because of this effect, but it wasn't until the 1950s that scientists began examining psilocybin's therapeutic properties in earnest.

Previous pilot studies have shown that psilocybin could be a promising new way to treat mental health symptoms like anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behavior and addiction. Those worried about the compound's effects on mental health needn't worry: Research shows that lifetime use of psychedelics like psilocybin is not an independent risk factor for mental health problems.

Beyond binding with the 5-HT2A receptor, scientists don't really understand the chemical process that leads to this psychedelic experience. It's even less clear how having a mystical experience might produce long-term mental health benefits, but there are at least two theories, according to Dr. Stephen Ross, director of the Psychedelic Research Group at NYU Langone Medical Center. He was not involved in the study, but reviewed it.

In the first theory, the memory of the ""trip"" -- which can be a profound and extremely meaningful experience -- could have a strong psychological effect on people, lifting their moods for months at a time. Alternatively, there may be a biological explanation: It's possible the binding of psilocin to the serotonin receptor sets off a cascade of yet-unknown chemical reactions that persist for weeks or months.

The study details:

Six men and six women with chronic, treatment-resistant, moderate to severe major depression consented to take two different doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg), separated by one week. There was no control group, and the participants and in what's called an ""open label trial,"" the investigators all knew that they were either taking or administering psilocybin.

During the dosing sessions, participants relaxed on a bed in a room with dim lighting and listened to music through earphones. Supervisors monitored their blood pressure, heart rate and the psychoactive effects of the compound intermittently for up to six hours after they took the pills, while psychiatrists offered support but mostly let patients have their own ""inner journey,"" as the study put it, without interruptions.

None of the participants experienced serious or unexpected negative side effects that required medical intervention from the dosing, though some reported mild anxiety, confusion, nausea or headache. The psychedelic effects peaked about two to three hours after dosing and then became negligible after about six hours.

Most significantly, eight of the 12 patients responded extremely well to the psilocybin, meeting the criteria for remission from depression one week after the two treatments. After three months, five of them remained in remission, while another two continued to show improvement in their depression symptoms compared to baseline. Overall, all 12 patients showed at least some improvement in their symptoms for up to three weeks after the dose.

The results seem promising, but there are some caveats. The overall positive response to the dosing treatment could in part be chalked up to the fact that the participants actively sought out the psilocybin trial and were probably expecting the medicine to work on some level, creating a bias in favor of the intervention. Indeed, five of the participants had already tried psilocybin at least once -- one just six months before the experiment, others ranging from 14 to 48 years prior.

This past experience with a drug and its presumed positive effects could increase suggestibility and expectancy in people, which could affect the results. Double-blind trials in which neither patient nor therapist knows which intervention they received or administered, as well as the inclusion of a control group, could address these issues in",0

"Mathematics: The Key to Unlocking the Mysteries of the Universe

Mathematics has been a subject of fascination for centuries, with its ability to explain the fundamental workings of the universe and provide insights into complex phenomena. From ancient civilizations to modern times, people have been using mathematics to solve problems, make predictions, and uncover hidden patterns in the world around us.

One of the most important applications of mathematics is in the field of science. Scientists use math to describe the behavior of everything from subatomic particles to the movements of galaxies. The laws of physics, for example, are based on mathematical principles, and the development of new technologies often relies on mathematical models.

Mathematics also plays a key role in the economy. Financial analysts, economists, and other professionals use mathematical tools to understand trends in markets, predict future outcomes, and make informed decisions. The use of mathematical models has become increasingly important in fields like finance, where complex algorithms are used to manage investments and reduce risk.

But mathematics is not just a practical tool for scientists and economists. It is also a beautiful and fascinating subject in its own right. Mathematicians explore abstract concepts like infinity, symmetry, and topology, and use rigorous proofs to discover new truths about the world. The beauty of mathematics lies in its ability to describe the world in precise and elegant terms, and to reveal hidden connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena.

Despite its importance, mathematics is often seen as a difficult and intimidating subject. Many students struggle to grasp complex concepts like calculus and linear algebra, leading some to believe that math is simply not for them. But with the right guidance and approach, anyone can learn to appreciate the beauty and power of mathematics.

At its core, mathematics is about problem-solving and critical thinking. By learning to think logically and systematically, students can develop the skills they need to succeed in any field. Whether you are interested in science, technology, engineering, or the arts, mathematics provides a solid foundation for success.

In short, mathematics is a vital subject",1

Participants were chanting ""Muhammad's army shall return"", ""We will hit the Jews with knives"" and ""We will shoot the Jews"". The demonstration went on with no intervention from the police.

"In January, Minnesota's top agriculture and environmental leaders gathered at a triumphant news conference to announce a $9 million federal grant for a novel project to help farmers protect streams and rivers from the chemicals that come off their land.

A one-year trial had been a resounding success, Agriculture Commissioner Dave Frederickson announced. The federal money, combined with another $11 million from the state, would finance a full-scale launch. It would make Minnesota a national leader in showing how farmers will step up to solve one of the country's most grievous environmental problems — agricultural water pollution.

But a growing chorus of critics is saying not so fast. Some say the project won't do enough to protect the water and that its effectiveness can't be measured. Others say it's not ready for prime time because its success with farmers so far has been spotty.

The surprisingly sharp discord that has erupted around the Water Quality Certification Program reflects a growing urgency about the best way to use $110 million a year in Legacy funding devoted to clean water. Even though the Legacy Amendment has 20 years of life left, many fear that Minnesota is running out of time to reverse a landscape-sized problem that was decades in the making.

And this particular investment ""falls short of its promotion,"" said Steve Morse, executive director of the Minnesota Environmental Partnership, which lobbies on behalf of environmental groups. In a state where chemically intensive agriculture occupies about half the land, the effort is a waste of money because it can never achieve ""the scale needed to correct the problem,"" he said.

Officials from the Minnesota Department of Agriculture say the program is a major step in on-farm conservation and water protection. It is unique because it uses a simple score to grade each farm as whole, and provides expert technical advice to help farmers design water-protection plans specific to each field.

Widespread resistance

Nothing will ever eliminate all agricultural water pollution, said assistant Agriculture Commissioner Matt Wohlman, ""but I think we will see measurable results here in Minnesota.""

But resistance to the effort is broad. In December, the state's Clean Water Council, which oversees Legacy money for clean water, refused to recommend the proposed increase in funding. Environmental groups are rallying against more taxpayer investment in a project without proven results. Now some key Republican legislators may put the brakes on.

""I don't think we are ready to go statewide,"" said Rep. Paul Torkelson, R-Hanska, a farmer who sits on the House environment committee and the Legacy Finance Committee.

The certification program was initiated with great fanfare nearly three years ago. Gov Mark Dayton stood with the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and other top officials to announce the first federal-state partnership in farm conservation. The ambitious strategy would give farmers a green seal of approval if they acted voluntarily to protect the water from fertilizer, soil erosion and other contamination. In return, they would be exempt from any new water-quality regulations — a ""certainty"" designed to woo farmers into signing up.

The idea was driven by a combination of political and fiscal realities that still stand. Farms are not covered by the federal Clean Water Act, the nation's main water pollution law, and regulating farmers faces political hurdles. At the same time, funding for long-standing farm conservation programs has been severely cut, and their financial incentives cannot compete with high commodity prices or federal subsidies that spur farmers to increase production.

Last year, with $3 million in Legacy funds and $3 million from the USDA, the state Agriculture Department started recruiting farmers in four watersheds. So far, just 30 farmers have succeeded in winning the green certification sign that they can post on their driveways, but some 260 more are in the process, officials say.

""It's somewhat difficult to attain,"" said Ken Schefers, a farmer near Paynesville who served on the program's advisory board, and was one of the first to sign up. He and his family raise a variety of crops and livestock, and he was already pretty water-conscious, he said. Even so, he had to conduct more soil tests and track his manure applications. He also added more grass buffers around his ditches and fields.

Mark Lefebvre, a specialist with the Stearns County Soil and Water Conservation District who works full-time for the certification program, said the scoring system, which rates farms from 1 to 10, is the best educational tool he's ever used in working with farmers.

""They can see their score on paper in black and white,"" he said.

Others say the scoring system, in practice, does little to protect the water. Kris Sigford, a water quality specialist with the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, said it does a poor job of accounting for the pesticides and nitrogen fertilizer lost through drainage systems that lie beneath a huge portion of the state's fields. That source alone makes up more than a third",0
"Machine Learning: Revolutionizing the Future

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that is rapidly changing the way we live our lives. It is a technology that enables machines to learn from data, just like humans do. It is the process of training machines to recognize patterns and make predictions based on those patterns.

The applications of machine learning are immense and diverse. From personalized recommendations on Netflix and Amazon to self-driving cars, machine learning has already started to impact our daily lives in ways we never thought possible. It has also proven to be a powerful tool in fields such as finance, healthcare, and marketing.

One of the most exciting aspects of machine learning is its potential to revolutionize fields such as medicine. With the help of machine learning, doctors can better diagnose diseases such as cancer and predict which treatments will be most effective for individual patients. In addition, machine learning can also be used to develop new drugs and treatments, creating a more efficient and personalized approach to healthcare.

Despite its many benefits, machine learning is not without its challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the need for large amounts of high-quality data. Without sufficient data, machine learning algorithms cannot learn and make accurate predictions. Additionally, there is also the risk of biased algorithms that can perpetuate existing social and economic inequalities.

Despite these challenges, machine learning is set to continue to change our lives in profound ways. By enabling us to make better decisions faster and more accurately, machine learning is paving the way for a more efficient and connected world.

As we continue to rely more and more on technology, it is essential that we harness the power of machine learning to bring about positive change. By investing in research and development, we can ensure that machine learning is used ethically and responsibly, benefiting society as a whole. The future of machine learning is bright, and it is up to us to shape it in a way that benefits us all.",1
"Generative AI: The Future of Creativity

Artificial intelligence has come a long way since its inception, and it has now taken on a new realm of creativity: generative AI. This technology allows machines to create original content, ranging from music and art to literature, with little to no human intervention. The emergence of generative AI has sparked a new wave of innovation and potential for industries such as entertainment, advertising, and beyond.

Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses machine learning algorithms to generate content that imitates the patterns and structures of real-world data. This technology has been used to create everything from music and poetry to images and videos. The ability to automatically generate new content is a game-changer for creative industries as it allows for an almost endless stream of new, original content.

One of the most groundbreaking applications of generative AI is in the field of music. With the help of machine learning algorithms, AI can now compose original pieces of music that sound like they were created by humans. AI-generated music has already been used in video games, films, and commercials, and it is only a matter of time before it becomes a staple in the music industry.

Another area where generative AI is making a significant impact is in the creation of art. AI-generated art has attracted attention from art collectors and enthusiasts alike. These pieces of art are often created by feeding the machine learning algorithm various images and patterns, which it then uses to create a unique piece of art. AI-generated art has the potential to revolutionize the art world by opening up new avenues for creativity and expression.

While generative AI is still in its early stages, it has already shown immense potential for industries looking to innovate and create new, original content. With the help of machine learning algorithms, AI can now generate content that is often indistinguishable from that created by humans. As technology continues to evolve, it is exciting to think about the possibilities that generative AI may hold for the future of creativity.",1

This technology has been around for decades, but recent advancements in computing power, data availability, and algorithms have spurred a machine learning revolution.

The applications of machine learning are vast and varied. In industries like healthcare, it's being used to improve diagnoses and personalize treatment plans. In finance, it's being used to detect fraud and automate trading decisions. In marketing, it's being used to predict customer behavior and optimize advertising campaigns. And the list goes on.

One of the key benefits of machine learning is its ability to process and analyze large amounts of data quickly and accurately. This allows businesses to make better decisions and identify patterns and trends that might not be visible to the human eye.

For example, a healthcare provider might use machine learning to analyze patient data and predict which patients are most at risk of developing a certain condition. This would allow them to take preventative measures and provide targeted interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Similarly, a financial institution might use machine learning to analyze transaction data and identify patterns of fraudulent activity. This would enable them to detect and prevent fraud more quickly and efficiently than traditional methods.

Of course, there are also challenges associated with machine learning. One of the biggest is the potential for bias and discrimination in algorithms. If the data used to train the algorithm is biased, this bias will be reflected in the algorithm's predictions and decisions.

To address this challenge, it's important to ensure that the data used to train machine learning algorithms is diverse and representative of the population it's meant to serve. Additionally, steps should be taken to monitor and mitigate bias in algorithms as they're developed and deployed.

Despite these challenges, machine learning has the potential to revolutionize industries and improve our lives in countless ways. As more businesses and organizations adopt this technology, we can expect to see even more innovative and impactful applications emerge.",1
"The war in Ukraine has raged on for several years now, leaving a trail of destruction and devastation in its wake. The conflict began in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, sparking a separatist movement in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Since then, the fighting has claimed the lives of thousands of people and displaced millions.

The situation in Ukraine remains tense with frequent clashes between Ukrainian military forces and Russian-backed separatists. Both sides have accused the other of violating the ceasefire agreements, leading to a cycle of violence that seems to have no end in sight.

The war has had a significant impact on the Ukrainian economy, with infrastructure and businesses being destroyed. The country's infrastructure has been severely damaged, making it difficult for aid to reach those in need. This has exacerbated the already dire situation in the region, with many people struggling to access basic necessities such as food and medical care.

As the conflict drags on, there is growing international concern about the situation in Ukraine. The United States and other Western countries have imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its annexation of Crimea and support for separatist forces. The European Union has also imposed sanctions on Russia, but there has been little progress in resolving the conflict.

The conflict has also had a significant impact on the people of Ukraine, with many having to flee their homes and seek refuge elsewhere. The humanitarian crisis in the region continues to grow, and many aid organizations are struggling to provide support to those in need.

In conclusion, the war in Ukraine remains a complex and challenging issue, with no easy solutions. The international community must continue to work towards finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict and providing humanitarian assistance to those affected by the war.",1
"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has been a major source of tension and concern for the international community since it began in 2014. The crisis began when protests erupted in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, leading to the ousting of then-President Viktor Yanukovych. Russia responded by annexing Crimea, a move that was widely condemned by the international community.

Since then, the conflict has escalated into a full-blown war between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. The fighting has left more than 13,000 people dead and displaced nearly 1.5 million. The conflict has also taken a toll on the Ukrainian economy, with the country facing a recession and high levels of debt.

The situation in Ukraine remains highly volatile, with frequent outbreaks of violence and ceasefire agreements that are often violated. In recent months, there has been a renewed push to find a political solution to the conflict. Negotiations between Ukraine, Russia, and European powers have been ongoing, but progress has been slow.

The war in Ukraine has also had a significant impact on global politics. The conflict has strained relations between Russia and the West, with many Western countries imposing sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine. The conflict has also raised concerns about the future of international security and the effectiveness of international institutions like the United Nations.

Overall, the war in Ukraine remains a complex and ongoing crisis that poses significant challenges for the international community. As efforts continue to find a peaceful resolution, it is clear that the conflict has already had a profound impact on the region and the world as a whole.",1

"Broncos head coach Vance Joseph has a clear plan in place for how he intends to use his quarterbacks and starters in Thursday's preseason opener at Chicago.

The starting defense, including pass rusher Von Miller, will play a maximum of three series to begin the game.

""It depends on how it goes,"" Joseph said. ""If they go out there and play a dominant series, they may play one. If they have a so-so series in the first and a better series in the second series, they'll only play two. But three max.""

On offense, Trevor Siemian was named the starting quarterback vs. the Bears; Paxton Lynch was named the starter for the second preseason game against San Francisco. Each quarterback, Joseph said, will play about a quarter and a half.

Starting running back C.J. Anderson will follow the script of the defense and play a maximum of three series. Veteran Stevan Ridley, rookie De'Angelo Henderson and Juwan Thompson will finish out the game. Veteran Jamaal Charles, who took more reps in practice Tuesday as the team moved back outside, will not play in Chicago.

""We want to stay with the plan for Jamaal and just give him more and more reps as we go along,"" Joseph said. ""Being inside (Monday), we didn't want him on the turf that much with his history. Back on the grass, we gave him more reps.""

The starting offensive line Thursday will consist of Garett Bolles at left tackle, Max Garcia at left guard, Connor McGovern at center, Ron Leary at right guard and Menelik Watson at right tackle. Matt Paradis, still easing his way back from two hip surgeries earlier this year, will not play.

Injury updates

Joseph said inside linebacker Todd Davis will not play in Thursday's preseason game because of the shoulder sprain that has kept him out of practices. Davis did not workout with the team Tuesday morning and Joseph said his availability in preseason could be limited because of the injury.

""His timeline, it's day-to-day,"" Joseph said. ""It's more precautionary for Todd than a concern.""

Corey Nelson will start with Davis sidelined.

""Corey is on the lines of (cornerback Bradley) Roby,"" Joseph said. ""He's our third inside linebacker, our starting dime player. So, in my opinion, Corey is a starter. On most teams, Corey would be a starter. If he had to play for us, I would have no problem with Corey being the (regular-season) starter for us.""

As for other injured or recovering players, running back Bernard Pierce (hamstring) did not practice Tuesday and safety T.J. Ward (hamstring) observed from the sideline. Joseph said Monday that Ward will not play Thursday.

Emergency plan

The Broncos opened Tuesday's practice by working on their contingency plans on special teams.

Defensive end Billy Winn stepped in as the emergency long snapper, Siemian took over for Riley Dixon as the emergency holder, and then Dixon dropped back as kicker. On punts, kicker Brandon McManus filled the emergency slot. McManus served as placekicker and punter and handled kickoffs while in college at Temple.

Footnotes

According to ESPN, quarterback Mike Glennon is expected to start Thursday's game in Chicago and will likely play a series or two. Mark Sanchez, a familiar face in Denver after last year's quarterback competition, and rookie Mitchell Trubisky will play the remainder of the game. … Special teams coordinator Brock Olivo was asked if Miller could seriously return punts. ""We could probably put Von back there alone,"" he said jokingly. ""I don't think there's anything Von Miller can't do. He's a great dancer, too."" … Joseph said offensive coordinator Mike McCoy and defensive coordinator Joe Woods will wear headsets on the sideline.",0
"Three Injured in Head-On Collision on Main Street

Three individuals were injured in a head-on collision on Main Street earlier today. The accident occurred at around 2:30 pm when a blue sedan, traveling northbound, crossed over into the southbound lane and collided with a white SUV.

Eyewitnesses reported hearing a loud bang and seeing smoke coming from both vehicles. The impact of the crash caused significant damage to both cars, leaving debris scattered across the roadway.

Emergency services were quick to respond to the scene, with ambulances and firefighters arriving within minutes of the accident being reported. The three individuals involved in the accident were extracted from the vehicles and taken to the hospital for treatment.

According to the police, the driver of the blue sedan is believed to have suffered some sort of medical emergency, causing him to lose control of his vehicle and cross into the opposite lane. The other two individuals involved in the accident suffered minor injuries and are expected to make a full recovery.

The accident caused significant traffic disruptions on Main Street, with the road closed to traffic for several hours while the debris was cleared and the vehicles were towed away.

The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of safe driving and the need to remain vigilant at all times when behind the wheel. Police are urging all drivers to ensure that they are in good health and take regular rest breaks to avoid fatigue while driving.",1
"If they plan on passing an online poker bill in 2014 the California legislature had better get a move on. The clock is ticking down on this legislative session, with just about two weeks remaining before the final buzzer sounds, and online poker has gone from a long-shot to a pipe dream.

Outside forces are certainly trying to get the legislature to act, from the 13 tribe coalition pushing their own bill to a group of 25 card rooms who recently sent a letter to two key individuals in the statehouse, Senator Lou Correa and Assemblyman Reginald Jones-Sawyer. And how can we forget the efforts of the Santa Ysabel tribe who are threatening to launch their own online poker website without the state's permission.

With so many possible scenarios capable of being played out over the next couple of weeks let's take a look at what will happen under the most likely scenario, which is the legislature not acting —The senate bill has already been pulled off the table according to the LA Times and the Assembly bill starting to look like a lost cause as well— and what that will lead to in California.

If the legislature punts

If the legislature does not act on online poker in the coming weeks we will learn one thing for certain; whether or not the Santa Ysabel tribe's threats to launch are real or if the tribe was bluffing to try and get a favorable bill passed.

My position all along has been that the Santa Ysabel threat was little more than a bluff designed to either get the legislature to act, and even more likely to make sure that some sort of revenue sharing bill was discussed with smaller tribes unable to pay the stiff licensing fees and compete with the larger tribes and card rooms.

Santa Ysabel has stuck with the story that they are serious about launching, and if the legislature does punt they very well might.

While I don't think their intention was to test the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and the definition of Class II gaming, they do have all the pieces in place to do so, including a software provider, a seemingly willing payment processor, and a regulatory agency housing their servers in Canada.

Frankly, the Santa Ysabel tribe has little to lose (the tribe is already in severe debt from its failed foray into brick & mortar gambling) but they could alter online poker in the US, and not necessarily for the better.

The effect on partnerships

We will also see what becomes of the partnerships and coalitions that have formed this year.

What becomes of PokerStars tentative partnership with the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, the Bicycle Casino, the Commerce Casino, and Hawaiian Gardens? What about the coalition of 13 tribes? Or the card rooms?

Some of the partnerships were simply ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" relationships and others were tenuous at best. Given a few months to reset and rethink their positions it's highly unlikely that these same partnerships will remain when the issue is taken up in the next legislative session.

This is especially applicable if (as I'll soon explain) the threat of a Bad Actor clause is off the table.

If there is suddenly zero chance that a Bad Actor clause will be included in an online poker bill introduced down the road I would expect the Morongo group and the coalition of 13 tribes and the 25 card rooms to suddenly see their interests aligned, but rifts could form over other policy disagreements, such as revenue sharing and even race tracks.

Bad Actor clause will likely be off the table

Remarkably, if the legislature is unable to get an online poker bill passed it will likely lead to the possibility of a Bad Actor clause being included next year somewhere in the 0.0 range.

The reason I say this is that PokerStars is expected to be licensed in New Jersey in the very near future, and it would be very difficult for any future state to pass a bill with a Bad Actor clause that would cover companies licensed in other states.

It's not impossible, but considering the legal fights that have already been suggested in California over the Bad Actor clause it seems highly unlikely that Bad Actor language would be applied if the company(s) in question are licensed in New Jersey.

There is also the not so small issue of Amaya Gaming suddenly falling into the Bad Actor category due to its ownership of PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker –virtually every casino/online casino uses Amaya licensed games.

Many pundits feel that certain tribes resolve against a Bad Actor clause was a stalling tactic to insure a bill was not passed — they essentially feigned a desire for online poker when they are actually against it but made sure the wedge issue was not resolved and killed the bill.

If this is the case then this will have backfired, as it only slightly delayed the inevitable and further aligned the many divergent interests in the state.",0

"The Facts on Unclaimed Land and Property in the UK

By: Garry Crystal - Updated: 19 Sep 2018 | *Discuss Tweet

It is not impossible to claim unregistered land and abandoned property in the UK but it will take some research and time. There is a legal process that must be followed when claiming unregistered land and the many thousands of abandoned properties in the UK.

Claiming Land and Property in the UK

It's doubtful that the UK is littered with unclaimed land and property. But land or property that is unregistered can be claimed by UK citizens and the first step will be actually locating the unregistered land or property. Tracking down unclaimed land and property is known as targeting. The next step will be to check with the UK Land Registry to ensure that the targeting land or property is unregistered. The Land Registry is available for inspection and should give information on the targeted land or property.

What Constitutes Unclaimed Land and Property?

Land that has being lying empty or vacant for years may actually be available to be claimed. This can also be true of derelict and abandoned properties. A postal code of the unclaimed land or property will required by the Land Registry. A search of the property or land through the Land Registry will come with a small fee. But simply because a property or plot of land is unregistered or looks abandoned does not mean that someone does not own it. There can be legal consequences for anyone who decides to simply occupy an abandoned plot of land or property

Claiming Unregistered Land in the UK

Claiming unregistered property or land is not a simple process. In order to claim abandoned land a person must first have taken possession of the land. This means erecting fences around the land and occupying it for a certain period of time, this is known as adverse possession. The adverse possession period is 10 years for registered land and 12 years for unregistered land. The person must also be able to prove that they have been in adverse possession for this amount of time. Only then will they be able to register with the Land Registry.

Searching Out Unclaimed Land or Property

Tracing or targeting unclaimed land or property may be one of the most difficult aspects. In most cases it will involve simply searching in person around a city or town. If land does look abandoned or a property looks old and vacant then it may be unregistered. There are usually properties that look as if they have been sitting vacant for many years. But this does not mean that the property is unregistered; this is the reason that the Land Registry must be used to access information on the property or land.

Spotting Unclaimed UK Property

There are a few signs that may help when trying to find abandoned property. These signs are not definite proof that the property is abandoned but can be a guide before checking with the land registry. Signs to look out for will include:

Boarded up windows and doors

Gardens that are unkempt and overgrown

The property has been uninhabited for many years and neighbours are unaware of tenants living there

The garden is often used for people tipping rubbish

The property is in great need of repair

There have been previous reports of squatters in the abandoned property

Vermin can be seen in the property gardens

Squatters Rights to Legally Claim Property

Squatting in abandoned properties has a long tradition in the UK. Squatting in England and Wales is not illegal although it is unlawful under civil law, and is illegal in Scotland. Squatters can actually become the legal occupiers, and in some cases owners, of abandoned properties in the UK. Squatting simply means entering an abandoned property and squatters do have rights once inside a property. The police cannot evict squatters from an abandoned property as it is a civil matter and squatters are provided with protection by law. Again, details of ownership of the property can be found through the Land Registry.

The internet has become rife with advertisements that claim to be able to show people the easy way to claim unregistered land that does not belong to anyone. Many of these advertisements will of course come with a fee to gain this knowledge. This information is widely available through the Land Registry. A detailed fact sheet on the steps required is available as well as information on the various false claims made in these advertisements. Checking with a local Land Registry will be beneficial in order to become aware of the rules and regulations that apply to unclaimed land and property.

A small, quick mod I made in my spare time. Adds a few new spells to Edgar in the Imperial City market district. All the summons scale with the player, and the master versions last until they die.


-Conjure Mountain Lion


-Conjure Troll


-Conjure Minotaur


-Conjure Goblin Shaman and Berserker


-Conjure Land Dreugh


Reading the Tome of Unlife gives the player the spells Worm Thrall, Conjure Black Soul Gem, and Imbue Worm Thrall. Worm Thrall costs one empty black soul gem, and turns the target into a zombie slave. Conjure Black Soul Gem does exactly what it sounds like. Imbue Worm Thrall only works on a Worm Thrall. It upgrades it into a stronger version, at the cost of another empty black soul gem and 100 health. The Tome of Unlife can also be used to combine soul gems to create stronger ones, and to summon an immortal skeleton companion called Creak. Lastly, the Tome makes the player count as a necromancer, making undead and necromancers friednly, and giving a -30 modifier towards the Mage's Guild.


Reading the Mysterium Xarxes lets summon Mehrunes Dagon.


Killing Jyggalag lets you summon him.


Finding the Great Welkynd Stone and Great Sigil Stone gives the player fragments of them, which are infinite use varla and sigil stones.


Edgar also sells two new spells, True Invisibility and Hunter's Sight. True Invisibility is 150% chameleon and fortify sneak, and the spell toggles it on and off. Hunter's Sight is a toggleable version of the vampire life detect (you do not need to be a vampire).


There's a Staff of Gandalf in the Arch Mage's quarters, where Hrormir's Ice Staff was.

"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has been a significant point of concern for the international community for several years now. The war began in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea, a Ukrainian territory, and has since escalated into a full-fledged armed conflict between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists.

The crisis has led to the deaths of over 13,000 people, including civilians, and has displaced more than 1.5 million people. The conflict has also created an economic crisis in Ukraine, with the country struggling to rebuild its infrastructure and economy.

Despite multiple ceasefires and peace talks, the conflict continues to escalate, with both sides accusing each other of violating ceasefire agreements. The situation remains tense, with frequent clashes and shelling in the areas controlled by separatists.

The international community, including the United Nations and European Union, has condemned the annexation of Crimea and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Sanctions have been imposed on Russia, and diplomatic efforts are ongoing to bring the parties to the negotiating table.

The conflict in Ukraine has also had global implications, with tensions rising between Russia and the West. The conflict has affected global energy markets, with Ukraine being a key transit country for Russian gas supplies to Europe.

The humanitarian situation in Ukraine remains dire, with many people struggling to access basic necessities like food and medical care. The conflict has had a significant impact on civilians, with many forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in other parts of Ukraine or neighboring countries.

Seahawks star Richard Sherman, who recently signed a four-year contract extension that could pay him more than $57 million, purchased a Maple Valley house from Seattle NBA star Jamal Crawford for $2.31 million.

Richard Sherman's rise from low-round draftee to NFL stardom with the Seahawks is the textbook sporting definition of going from the outhouse to the penthouse.

So why wouldn't a mansion be next?

Public records show that Sherman on Friday completed the purchase of a 9,475-square-foot home in Maple Valley resting neatly on 4.96 acres. He bought the house from another famous athlete with Seattle ties — NBA star Jamal Crawford.

Sherman paid $2.31 million to buy the house from Crawford, a former Rainier Beach High star who plays for the Los Angeles Clippers.

The purchase came shortly after Sherman signed a four-year contract extension with the Seahawks that could pay him more than $57 million through the 2018 season.

Sherman said Monday the contract won't change him, calling himself still the ""raggedy dog'' who entered the NFL as a fifth-round pick in 2011, regarded by many as something of an afterthought.

""You can teach an old dog new tricks,'' Sherman said Monday, referring to his humble roots in Compton, Calif. ""But you can't take him away from where he is from.''

NFL riches can, though, buy him a nice new crib in which to hang out.

Real-estate listings detail that the Mediterranean-style house has an indoor pool/hot tub, three outdoor water features, a billiards room and game room, a wet bar, a personal beauty salon, an athletic court, two floor-to-ceiling rustic stone fire­places, three bedrooms with private decks and, yes, a dog run.

It also contains 6.25 baths, four bedrooms, six covered parking spaces and according to one real-estate listing ""a double kitchen with two of everything.''

All decidedly not me-di-o-cre.

"Washington D.C. - The political world has been abuzz with the recent actions of Senator John Smith, a prominent politician from the state of California. Elected to the Senate in 2010, Smith has been a leading voice on issues ranging from immigration reform to healthcare.

Most recently, Smith has been in the news for his vocal opposition to the Trump administration's policies on immigration. He has been a fierce advocate for protecting the rights of undocumented immigrants, and has been a vocal critic of the President's plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Smith has also been working on a bill that would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have been living in the United States for a certain number of years. The bill has garnered support from both Democrats and Republicans, and could potentially become law in the near future.

In addition to his work on immigration, Smith has been a strong advocate for healthcare reform. He has been a vocal supporter of the Affordable Care Act, and has been working to protect it from efforts to repeal or undermine it.

Smith's work on these issues has earned him a reputation as a progressive leader in the Senate. He has shown a willingness to stand up for what he believes in, even in the face of opposition from powerful interests.

Despite his success, Smith has faced criticism from some quarters for his outspokenness and willingness to take on controversial issues. Some have accused him of being too partisan, while others have criticized him for not being more aggressive in his efforts to push through his legislative agenda.

Regardless of the criticisms, however, Smith remains a prominent and influential figure in the political world. His work on immigration and healthcare reform has earned him the respect of his colleagues, and his commitment to fighting for the rights of all Americans has made him a hero to many.",1

NEWS FLASH: U.S. Forest Service closes sport climbing on public lands pending compliance with UIAA materials recommendations.

OK, that's a lie, it hasn't happened—yet. In April 2016, the Access Fund (AF) and Petzl sponsored the second Future of Fixed Anchors Conference. Approximately 60 policy wonks, bolting geeks, and climbing organization representatives from all over the country gathered in Las Vegas to discuss bolting, hardware, removal techniques, funding, liability insurance for hardware-replacement organizations, best practices, worst practices, and bolting as a public service. Another topic of discussion was the imminent UIAA materials recommendations.

The original sport climbing boom of the 1990s installed a staggering number of bolts on hundreds of crags all across the country. Twenty-plus years later, this hardware is reaching the end of its life. Many of these old bolts may be fine. But many aren't. On most sport climbs, if a single bolt fails, the consequences can be dire. Added to that, many of us bend safety rules. Have you ever bailed off a route on a single bolt? Ever taken a victory whip? Or clipped in direct while your partner takes you off belay to extract her dog from a fight?

Fortunately, when correctly placed, modern climbing bolts are strong and reliable enough that accidents are rare. Problems arise as bolts age. And around the country, bolts are aging.

Most of the bolts placed in the 1990s and earlier were made from zinc-plated steel. Zinc is the material that keeps chain-link fences from rusting, which occurs when iron reacts with oxygen. Zinc reacts so strongly with oxygen that as long as zinc is present, oxygen ignores the iron and zinc-plated steel won't rust. Unfortunately, bolts are electroplated (so their small threads can still work) and the zinc coating is thin. The zinc soon disappears, turning into zinc oxide that can scrape away, or zinc chloride that simply washes off, leaving the underlying steel unprotected. It's like peeling an egg. Once the shell—or part of the shell—is gone, the bolt's tasty iron insides are consumed. It takes a couple of decades depending on weather and climate, but rust will ruin the bolt.

Worse, corrosion hides inside the hole in the rock, making it impossible to detect. Even in dry climbing areas, the insides of bolt holes form shady, often moist micro-environments that hold water, then dry out, concentrating the minerals that speed corrosion. The bolt's externals and hanger may look OK, while the internal parts—including the small clips and wedges that allow the bolt to grip the rock and hold falls—may be compromised. Kenny Parker, the chief re-equipper for New River Alliance of Climbers (NRAC) at West Virginia's New River Gorge, reports that on some 20-year-old sport routes he's replaced, one old bolt might be quite strong, requiring aggressive crowbarring to budge. Yet another bolt just a few feet away pulls or snaps off effortlessly. You just never know. Victory whip, anyone?

Bolts may be aging, but in most popular climbing areas, local communities are on task, upgrading hardware with long-lasting stainless steel. Unlike zinc plating, the ""stainless"" process puts the oxygen-attracting metals within the steel itself, so the bolt's corrosion-resisting shell continually renews itself. But replacing bolts—removing them, re-drilling existing holes, or in some cases drilling new holes—requires a significant investment of time and money. In areas like Boulder and Yosemite that have a high level of commitment to reusing original bolt holes, it may take a skilled worker all day, sometimes more, to re-equip a single sport route. Plus, steep rock, use of glue-ins, difficult access, or anchors that can't be trusted even to facilitate re-equipping all add to the time required.

For perspective, a small sport climbing sector such as the Arsenal at Rifle Mountain Park, Colorado, might take one skilled person two to three weeks of full-time work to re-equip. Rifle is a small climbing area, and the Arsenal is just one of its 30 sectors. Multiply that by the many hundreds of climbing areas in the country and you are talking about tens of thousands of hours of work. Not to mention the expense of the stainless steel replacement hardware itself.

The good news is that local climbing communities have been very good at getting this work done and new hardware paid for. Boulder, Rifle, the New, the Red, Rumney, Yosemite, Joshua Tree—these and many other well-known areas are on it. The bad news is that hundreds",0
"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has been a major global issue since 2014, when Russian annexation of Crimea sparked a series of events leading to war in Eastern Ukraine. Despite ceasefires and peace agreements, the situation remains volatile and deadly.

The conflict began when pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions declared independence from Ukraine and a war broke out between them and the Ukrainian government. Russia has been accused of supplying arms and troops to the separatists, a claim that it denies.

The war has been devastating for the people of Ukraine, with over 13,000 deaths and more than 1.5 million people displaced. The conflict has also caused economic damage, with Ukraine's heavy industry in the east suffering greatly.

International efforts to resolve the conflict have been largely unsuccessful, with peace talks at times breaking down. The United States and European Union have imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine, but the conflict remains unresolved.

In recent months, there has been an increase in ceasefire violations and clashes between Ukrainian forces and separatists. In April, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, called for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to find a way to end the conflict, but the meeting ended without any significant progress.

The conflict in Ukraine remains a major challenge for the international community. The situation is complex, with political, economic, and historical factors contributing to the conflict. However, it is clear that the ongoing violence and suffering of the people of Ukraine must be brought to an end.",1
"The Harsh Realities of Recycling in the Rockies

Lifting the lid on waste removal in the Canadian Rocky Mountains.


This article originally ran as ""Out of Sight, Out of Mind"" in the Winter 2014 issue of Highline Magazine.

""What's in the bag?"" I whisper, watching the hairs on my buddy's neck stand on end. My accusatory heckle hisses through the shadowy night in a quiet residential neighbourhood in Jasper. I'm taking out the trash from a post-housewarming soiree. My friend, who didn't see me coming, is disposing of what looks to be his dog's fecal matter.

Meeting someone at the garbage is always a social occasion.

I'm slinking to the bins in the dead of night to dump a salmon carcass. I'm not sure if the remnants should go in compost or garbage, and frankly, I'll use the cloak of darkness to conceal my confusion. As for my buddy, he's just being a responsible dog walker.

Is he going to compost that? I wonder.

After seeing the unsorted mess that several inconsiderate ""recyclers"" have left in the cardboard, compost and garbage disposal containers lately, I have become wary of midnight dumpers. Over the last few weeks, with barely-repressed rage, I have discovered that, when it comes to properly sorting their refuse, some people in Jasper's newest housing development have not been pulling their weight. Smugly protective of my new neighbourhood's image (and known to rant when it comes to individual laziness that disrupts the collective harmony), tonight I am en guard. I am on self-appointed sanitary sentinel duty. I am a citizen on patrol.

Until it starts to feel weird.

It's easy for righteous writers, promise-prone politicians and naive neighbourhood watchers to make pronouncements appealing to our inner environmentalist, but managing our waste in Jasper, Banff and Canmore is like Oscar the Grouch's hoarding complex: it's complicated. Our increased awareness of the natural world is colliding with our ever-constant quandary of convenience over cost. And while there are lots of ways to tackle waste management, there is consensus that the consequences of managing it poorly will sell our future short, both environmentally and economically. In the Rockies, because of our communities' isolation, our close quarters with wildlife and the unique inputs and outputs of a high-volume tourism sector, the Three R's quickly turn into the Three C's: complexity, costliness and contradictions. Where to put the salmon bones is one thing; how to improve our waste diversion efforts is another kettle of fish altogether.

Bear proof = Blame proof

After I realize it's my friend in the shadows and not a hungry grizzly bear, a machete-wielding serial killer, or a gaggle of wine-cooler-drinking 16-year-olds (my worst fears, not necessarily in that order), I remember it wasn't so long ago in Jasper that the fear of bumping into a four-legged dumpster diver was a legitimate concern. Before the community had locking, ursine proof bins installed, black bears and even the occasional grizzly roamed Jasper backyards in search of tasty rewards.

""There was a time when bears were as common as dogs,"" remembers 87-year-old Jasperite, Wanda Garford. ""You couldn't go down an alley without running into a bear.""

Inevitably, human-wildlife conflicts were regular occurrences. As such, when locking-lidded infrastructure was installed in Canada's mountain parks in the 1980s, it was heralded as a great leap forward in managing how humans could live amongst wild animals.

But sealing the garbage off had another effect, although it would be years before it was identified as somewhat counter-intuitive to environmental best practices. In 2007, when the Municipality of Jasper conducted a waste audit, they learned that despite having implemented a residential recycling and compost program, the amount of materials which could have been diverted from the waste stream was more or less the same as when their recycling programs were nascent: somewhere around 30 per cent. And it hasn't improved much since. Those who were historically more inclined to sorting their waste — long-term residents who lived in single family dwellings — continued to do so, while those who were typically poor recyclers and composters — young people living in staff accommodations — remained negligent.

""[The diversion rate] has flat-lined. It's depressing,"" Jasper's Environmental Stewardship Coordinator, Janet Cooper, said in 2010.

At the root of the plateauing waste diversion rates is not just that 20-year-old lifties and weekenders are disinclined to sort their cardboard; rather it's the fact that they aren't compelled to do it — in fact, neither is anyone in Jasper",0

"Machine Learning: Revolutionizing the Way We Live

Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI), has been gaining momentum in recent years. It is a powerful tool that allows machines to learn from data, improve their performance over time, and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. As a result, machine learning has the potential to revolutionize the way we live, work, and interact with technology.

One of the most significant benefits of machine learning is its ability to automate tasks that were previously performed by humans. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to automate customer service inquiries, detect fraud, and optimize supply chain management. This not only saves time and resources but also reduces the risk of errors and improves the quality of the output.

Another area where machine learning is making a significant impact is in healthcare. Machine learning algorithms can analyze large amounts of medical data and help doctors make more accurate diagnoses and develop more effective treatment plans. For example, machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the likelihood of heart failure, detect skin cancer, and identify patients at risk for readmission.

Machine learning is also transforming the way we interact with technology. Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms are making it possible for machines to understand and respond to human language. This has led to the development of virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, which can help us with tasks like scheduling appointments, playing music, and providing weather updates.

Despite these benefits, machine learning is not without its challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the ethical implications of using machine learning algorithms in decision-making processes. For example, if a machine learning algorithm is used to make decisions about job applicants or mortgage applications, there is a risk of bias and discrimination. It is essential to ensure that these algorithms are transparent, accountable, and fair.

In conclusion, machine learning is a powerful technology that has the potential to transform the way we live, work, and interact with technology. It has already made significant strides in automating tasks, improving healthcare, and enhancing our interactions with virtual assistants. However, it is crucial to address the ethical implications of using machine learning algorithms to ensure that they are used responsibly and in a way that benefits society as a whole.",1
"Machine Learning: The Future of Technology

Machine learning has become one of the hottest topics in the world of technology. It is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows machines to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning has been applied in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce.

One of the main advantages of machine learning is its ability to analyze and process large amounts of data. This has revolutionized how businesses operate by allowing them to make data-driven decisions. Machine learning algorithms can quickly identify patterns and insights that would take humans a long time to process.

In healthcare, machine learning has been used to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. For instance, it can help doctors make more accurate diagnoses by analyzing medical images and identifying early signs of diseases. It can also help hospitals optimize their resources by predicting patient demand and preventing readmissions.

In finance, machine learning has been used to detect fraud and prevent financial crimes. It can analyze large sets of transactional data and identify unusual patterns that may indicate fraudulent activities. Machine learning algorithms can also help financial institutions make better investment decisions by predicting market trends and identifying profitable opportunities.

In e-commerce, machine learning has been used to personalize customer experiences and improve sales. It can analyze customer data and behavior to recommend products and services that are tailored to their preferences. It can also predict customer churn and identify loyal customers, which can help businesses improve customer retention.

However, machine learning is not without its challenges. One of the main concerns is the potential bias in the algorithms. Machine learning algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the data is biased, the algorithms will also be biased. This can lead to discriminatory outcomes and perpetuate social inequalities.

Another concern is the ethical implications of machine learning. As machines become more advanced, they may begin to make decisions that have a significant impact on people's lives. It is crucial that we develop ethical guidelines and regulations to ensure that machine learning is used in a responsible and transparent way.

In conclusion, machine learning is a powerful tool that has the potential to transform various industries. It can help businesses make better decisions, improve healthcare outcomes, and prevent financial crimes. However, we must also be aware of its limitations and potential implications. As we continue to develop this technology, we must ensure that it is used in a responsible and ethical manner.",1
"Tragedy Strikes as Car Crashes into Pedestrians

In a terrible accident that has left residents of Main Street reeling, a car crashed into a group of pedestrians last night, resulting in several injuries and one fatality.

According to eyewitnesses, the car appeared to be traveling at an excessive speed before it careened onto the sidewalk and struck the group of people. The driver, identified as 27-year-old John Smith, is believed to have lost control of the vehicle while trying to avoid another car that had swerved in front of him.

First responders were quickly on the scene, attending to the wounded and transporting them to nearby hospitals. Among the victims was 65-year-old Martha Johnson, who tragically succumbed to her injuries at the hospital later that night.

The incident has left many in shock and mourning. Johnson was a beloved member of the community and a well-known volunteer at the local church. Friends and family express their devastation at her loss.

The driver of the car, John Smith, sustained minor injuries in the accident and was taken into police custody for questioning. Authorities are investigating the incident and have not yet released further details.

In the wake of this tragedy, residents are calling for increased safety measures to be put in place on Main Street, including improved traffic signals and speed limits. Our hearts go out to all those affected by this senseless act of violence.",1
"Generative AI: The Future of Creativity?

Artificial intelligence (AI) has come a long way in recent years, and one of the most exciting developments in the field is generative AI. Unlike traditional AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks, generative AI is capable of creating new and unique content on its own.

Generative AI works by analyzing large amounts of data and using that data to create something new. For example, a generative AI system can be trained on thousands of images of flowers, and then use that data to generate new, never-before-seen images of flowers. The possibilities are endless, and generative AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, including art, music, and fashion.

One of the most famous examples of generative AI is the Google DeepDream project. This project uses generative AI to create psychedelic, dream-like images by analyzing and manipulating existing images. Another example is the music generated by AI composer AIVA, which has been used in advertising campaigns and even composed a symphony that was performed by a human orchestra.

Despite the exciting possibilities, there are also concerns about generative AI. Some worry that it could be used to create convincing fake news or even deepfake videos that could be used for malicious purposes. Others worry about the impact on jobs, as generative AI has the potential to automate many creative tasks.

However, proponents of generative AI argue that it has the potential to enhance creativity and open up new avenues for artistic expression. With generative AI, artists can collaborate with machines to create new and unique works of art, music, and fashion.

As generative AI continues to develop and evolve, it will be interesting to see how it is used and how it changes the way we think about creativity. Whether it is embraced or feared, it is clear that generative AI is a fascinating and game-changing technology that will have a significant impact on our future.",1
"Science is constantly pushing the boundaries of what we know about the world around us. From unraveling the mysteries of the universe to finding cures for diseases, science has enabled us to make incredible strides in our understanding of the world we live in.

One of the most exciting areas of science today is in the field of genetics. Researchers are now able to sequence entire genomes, opening up new avenues for personalized medicine and allowing us to better understand the genetic basis of diseases. The possibilities for using this knowledge to improve human health are truly remarkable.

Another exciting area of science is in the study of climate change. As we continue to see the effects of global warming and its impact on our planet, scientists are working to develop new technologies and strategies to mitigate its effects. From developing new renewable energy sources to finding ways to capture and store carbon, the work being done in this field is critical to ensuring a sustainable future for our planet.

"It is not a matter of being optimistic or pessimistic, knowing or not knowing elementary things, of being responsible or not for events. Those who would like to be thought of as politicians should be thrown onto the trash heap of history when, as the norm goes, they have no idea about everything or almost everything related to it in that activity.

Of course I am not speaking about those who throughout the various millennia turned public affairs into instruments of power and wealth for the privileged classes, an activity where the real records of cruelty have been imposed during the last eight or ten thousand years about those we have certain traces of the social behaviour of our species, whose existence as thinking beings, according to scientists, barely covers 180,000 years.

It is not my purpose to get involved in such topics that would surely bore almost one hundred percent of the people continuously being bombarded with news across the media, going from the written word to three-dimensional images that are starting to be shown in expensive cinemas. The day is not far away when they shall also predominate in the already fabulous television images per se. It is no accident that the so-called leisure industry has its headquarters in the heart of the empire that tyrannizes everybody.

What I would like to do is to rest on the current starting point of our species to speak of the march towards the abyss. I might even speak of an ""inexorable"" march and I would certainly be closer to reality. The idea of a Last Judgement is implicit in the most practiced religious doctrines among the inhabitants of this planet, without anyone classifying them for that as being pessimistic. On the contrary, I think it is a basic duty of all serious and sane persons, who number in the millions, to fight to postpone and perhaps to prevent that dramatic and imminent event in today's world.

Numerous dangers threaten us, but two of them, nuclear war and climate change, are decisive and both are ever farther away from coming close to a solution.

Verbose demagoguery, the statements and speeches of the tyranny imposed upon the world by the United States and its powerful and unconditional allies, on both topics, do not admit the slightest doubt in that respect.

January 1st of 2012, the western and Christian New Year, coincides with the anniversary of the triumph of the Revolution in Cuba and the year celebrating the 50th anniversary of the October Crisis of 1962 that put the world on the brink of a nuclear world war and this forces me to write these lines.

My words would be lacking in meaning if they had the objective of blaming on the American people, or on any other country which is an ally of the United States in the unusual adventure; they, like all the other peoples of the world, would be the inevitable victims of the tragedy. Recent events happening in Europe and elsewhere show massive indignation by those who are led to protest by the unemployment, shortages, reductions in their incomes, debts, discrimination, lies and politicking and lead to brutal repressions by the guardians of established law and order.

With growing frequency one speaks of military technologies that affect the entire planet, the only satellite known to be inhabitable hundreds of light years away from any other that may perhaps be suitable if we were to move at the speed of light, three hundred thousand kilometres per second.

We should not ignore that if our marvellous thinking species should disappear, many millions of years would go by before another one capable of thinking would arise, by virtue of the natural principles that rule as a consequence of the evolution of the species, discovered by Darwin in 1859 and which today is acknowledged by all serious scientists, whether they are religious or not.

No other era in the history of mankind has known the dangers that today humanity faces. Persons like me, at 85 years old, had reached our 18th birthdays with high school graduation degrees before the first atomic bomb had been put together.

Today artefacts of this type, ready to be used – incomparably more powerful than those that produced the heat of the sun over the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki─ add up to thousands.

Weapons of this kind that are kept in storage, added to those already deployed by virtue of agreements, reach figures that surpass twenty thousand nuclear missiles.

The use of just one hundred or so of those weapons would be enough to create nuclear winter that would cause a horrible death in a short time for all the human beings living on the planet, as the American scientist and Rutgers University professor Alan Robock has brilliantly explained along with computerized data.

Those used to reading news and serious international analyses know how the risks of the outbreak of war with the use of nuclear weapons increase as the tension grows in the Middle East, where in the hands of the Israeli government hundreds of combat-ready nuclear weapons are accumulated, and whose nature as a strong nuclear power is neither admitted or denied. Likewise, tension grows around Russia, a country with unquestionable capacity for response, threatened by",0
"Generative AI: The Future of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a hot topic for years, and now with the rise of generative AI, the potential for AI technology is greater than ever before. Generative AI allows computers to generate content such as images, music, and even text, which opens up a wealth of opportunities.

One of the most exciting areas of generative AI is its potential in the creative arts. With the ability to generate unique and original content, artists and musicians can push the boundaries of what is possible. For example, generative AI has been used to create music that adapts to the listener's emotions, creating a unique experience every time it is played. Similarly, generative AI has been used to create stunning visuals that can be used in everything from video games to advertising campaigns.

Another area of application for generative AI is in healthcare. With the ability to analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize medical diagnosis and treatment. For example, generative AI can be used to analyze medical images such as X-rays and MRIs, which can help doctors detect diseases at an earlier stage and improve patient outcomes.

However, with any new technology, there are concerns about its impact on society. One concern is that generative AI could be used to create fake content that is difficult to distinguish from reality. In the wrong hands, this technology could be used to spread misinformation or even to manipulate public opinion.

Despite these concerns, the potential of generative AI is vast, and it is clear that this technology is here to stay. As researchers continue to explore new applications and refine the technology, we can expect to see even more exciting developments in the future.

In conclusion, generative AI represents a significant step forward in the field of AI and has the potential to transform numerous industries. However, as with any powerful technology, it is essential that we approach generative AI with caution and ensure that it is used responsibly to benefit society as a whole.",1
"Remarks prepared for ""Fighting Inequality: Leveraging Opportunities for Innovation,"" Project on Municipal Innovation, September 24, Harvard Kennedy School.

I told a colleague I was going to give a talk about inequality, but that I had to do it over dessert, and I wasn't sure how that was going to go over. She said, ""It's perfect … let them eat cake.""

Ben and Steven and the good folks at Living Cities invited me here tonight because inequality is a key theme of your gathering over the next day.

And inequality, particularly in big cities, is something that's been a bigger part of the national dialogue over the past few years, probably starting with Occupy Wall Street in 2011.

Soon thereafter in 2013, there were a series of elections across many of your cities where the issue of inequality, and what mayors should do about it, was a big part of the debate. New York, Minneapolis, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles, and others.

This was no straw man issue. Inequality is indeed high and rising in many American cities.

San Francisco seems to be the quintessential example, and with good reason. The Chronicle ran a piece a couple weeks back entitled, ""San Francisco's strange detour from paradise to parody."" It quoted a longtime resident of the Mission District, ground zero for the city's gentrification:

""I live one block away from Valencia Street, where there's a new restaurant that opens up every 15 minutes. How many chocolate shops does Valencia need?""

About a one-bedroom apartment in the Mission advertised for $6,800/month: ""I did the math: $80,000 for rent for a year? You could buy three houses in Buffalo.""

But these absurd stories and my previous work on inequality weren't really the impetus for my talk, or for the conversations you'll have tomorrow.

Rather, I think what drove this focus was the events that unfolded in Baltimore back in April and May, which came in close proximity to others in Ferguson, Mo.; in Staten Island, N.Y.; in North Charleston, S.C.

The obvious common thread was the tragic death of an African American male at the hands of police … and the tensions they exposed between minority communities and law enforcement, bred in part by a long history of misguided criminal justice practices and policies.

You can see this tension in the words of West Baltimore residents quoted in the Baltimore Sun during the days of the unrest. Here are a few:

– Resa Burton, a lifelong West Baltimore resident: ""They killed a man, but it could've been me! It could've been me! It could been my brother, my nephew! It could've been you!"" – Vaughn DeVaughn, a city teacher: ""This is about anger and frustration and them not knowing how to express it."" Author Alan Berube Senior Fellow and Deputy Director - Metropolitan Policy Program – Sandra Almond-Cooper, president of the Mondawmin Neighborhood Improvement Association: ""These kids are just angry,"" Almond-Cooper said. ""These are the same kids they [meaning the police] pull up on the corner for no reason.""

These are the very real, very raw surface issues that Freddie Gray's death—and Michael Brown's, and Eric Garner's, and Walter Scott's—exposed.

Several weeks after the unrest, a video team from Brookings went to West Baltimore, and talked to a number of young people. I highly recommend the video, you can Google ""Brookings Baltimore"" to find it. Here were some of the quotes from the young people in that video:

""Within my community, everything is divided. You have one community, and you cross the street, into a complete other community where the poverty, and the neighborhood, and the people are completely different, even though we're just five minutes away."" ""Where I live, you've got houses that are boarded up, and have trash."" ""Everything is still segregated, opportunities are different, kids aren't allowed to go to certain schools, if they do, they won't feel comfortable, they'll feel like outcasts in those schools."" ""Educational opportunities in my neighborhood are poor.""

It was those underlying issues, issues that lie at the confluence of race, place, and opportunity in America, that motivated a colleague and I (a Baltimore resident) to write a piece in the wake of the unrest.

We called it, ""Good fortune, dire poverty, and inequality in Baltimore: An American story."" The title was more about the art of search engine optimization than anything else.

But we wrote it in part as a response to the emerging narratives in the media about the deeper structural issues in Baltimore that fueled the unrest. Narratives like:

– Baltimore is ""The Wire."" It's ""Homicide: Life on the Street."" It's a dangerous city overrun by crime and the drug trade. Or",0

De Friezen binne in Germaansk folk, troch Tacitus rekkene ta de Ingvaeones, de Germaanske folken oan de Noardseekust.

Oan it begjin fan ús jiertelling skreaunen de Romeinen fan de Friezen oan de kust fan de Noardsee. Om't de Friezen útwreiden nei it suden wylst de Romeinen nei it noarden kamen, moeten de twa folken inoar, en doe't de Romeinen in grins fêststeld hienen, wienen der Friezen binnen en bûten it Romeinske Ryk. De Romeinen hienen it oer Frisiavones foar de minsken dy't besuden de Ryn wennen, en dermei part fan it ryk wienen, en fan Frisii foar de lju oer de Ryn, dy't gjin fêst part fan it ryk wienen, al waarden se al troch de Romeinen betwongen. Sjoen troch de eagen fan de Romeinen wienen de Frisii in nuver folk, om't se libben yn in gebiet dat twa kear deis ûnder wetter rekke.

Meidat de Romeinen weifoelen, begûn de groei fan it Fryske gebiet op 'e nij. Mei it grutte folkeferfarren kamen se mei de Angel-Saksen nei Ingelân, dêr't se harren fêstigen yn de eastlike kriten. De Friezen gouwen yn dy tiid as in folk fan seefarders; sa lyk dat de Noardsee yn dy tiid de Mare Frisicum (Fryske See) neamd waard. It Fryske ryk woeks út oant it yn de 7e ieu rikte oan de Weser yn it easten ta, en oant Brugge yn it suden. Stêden as Utert en Dorestêd moatte wichtige Frykse hannelsstêden west hawwe.

Yn it lege lân libben de Friezen yn in altyd trochgeande kriich mei it wetter. Oan de iene kant wie dêr de see, oan de oare kant it fean, dat omleech gong as it bewenne waard. De Friezen bouden terpen,",0
"Headline: Fatal Accident on Highway 101 Claims Two Lives

San Francisco, CA - A tragic accident on Highway 101 claimed the lives of two individuals and left several others injured on Tuesday afternoon. The accident occurred on the northbound lanes of the highway, near the Cesar Chavez exit ramp.

According to witnesses, a grey sedan was traveling at a high rate of speed when it collided with a white SUV, causing both vehicles to spin out of control and collide with two other cars. The impact of the collision was so severe that it caused the SUV to roll over several times before coming to a stop.

Emergency services were immediately alerted and rushed to the scene of the accident. Upon arrival, they found two passengers of the SUV, a male and a female, trapped inside the vehicle and were pronounced dead on the scene. The driver of the sedan and two other passengers of the other vehicles involved in the accident were taken to the hospital with severe injuries.

The accident resulted in the closure of all northbound lanes on Highway 101 for several hours, causing major traffic backups in the area. The cause of the accident is still under investigation, and the identities of the deceased have not yet been released pending notification of their next of kin.

The California Highway Patrol has warned drivers to exercise caution while driving on the highways, especially during the holiday season, where the number of accidents usually increases due to alcohol consumption and other distractions on the road.

This accident is a sobering reminder of the importance of safe driving practices and following traffic laws to avoid such tragic incidents. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the deceased, and we hope for a speedy recovery of those injured.",1

"Victorinox Pioneer Swiss Army Pocket Knife Review

Founded in 1884, Victorinox is a knife manufacturer out of Switzerland that is the sole supplier of multi-purpose knives to the Swiss army. Which is what most of us know them from, Swiss Army Knives. It is definitely what I know them from, having been issued a Victorinox pocket knife when I started my tour of duty with the Royal Dutch Military Police, some time ago now.

And let me tell you, that little Victorinox knife served me well. Especially when guarding some completely deserted cross road in the middle of a forest, fighting blazing colds, waiting day and night for that one moment when a tank commander decided to have his battle tanks cross the street. We than needed to make sure no civilians were crushed by them. Being a corporal I was the highest ranking guy out there most of the time, which gave a little wiggle room. So at one point we decided that it would be a good idea to bring a small stove with us, a few cans of sausages and make the best of it. And we did.

This pocket knife review is about the tool that helped make that happen, the Victorinox Pioneer. It is a compact multi-tool for hiking, camping, or around-the-house use, and apparently also stuck-in-a-forest-MP's . The build quality is every bit as good as you might expect from a Swiss knife. Victorinox is so convinced of its build quality that they give a lifetime warranty.

The Pioneer is enclosed in a stylish ribbed silver Alox housing that provides a good deal of grip. It measures 3.5 inches overall and weighs a mere 3.2 ounces. The blade is nice and big for a pocket knife as it comes in at 2.5 inches. Its very sharp out of the box, ready to be used.

Going over the tools you'll find a very effective can opener. Don't be fooled, this little thing will open about any can regular with ease. To proof that I opened a can of Tuna Fish, which took me just 59 seconds and really no effort at all. Check out this amazing feat on the video below.

On the tip of the can opener you'll find a small screwdriver, good for tightening everyday screws around the house. On the other end there's a bottle opener, with large screwdriver on the tip and a wire stripper at the bottom. Opposite to that sits the Reamer. Now most people don't know what a reamer is for, but simply put, it is a tool for making holes. One use case could be to make a hole in a branch or pole to run paracord through so you can more securely strap a knife to it to make a spear. This opposed to just wrapping the cord around the branch or pole, something I see a lot of guys do, which doesn't firmly hold the knife in place at all.

The Pioneer comes with a small, yet strong keyring and it has an engraving panel on back. The panel is nice, but not to big. So don't think of engraving a poem on there, not even a haiku. A first name or phone number will be about it if you're planning on keeping it readable.

If you like the Victorinox Pioneer and you would want one yourself you could follow this link to it on Amazon to check it out for yourself. It is an affiliate link, so if you decide to use it I will get a small commission. In case you do, let me just thank you ahead already. I really appreciate that, Thank you.

That's all for now, thanks for reading this far. I'd love to hear what your ideas are on what pocket knife and tool you would choose for an urban setting, and especially why, so please leave your comments below.

Till next time, Kain.",0
"President Barack Obama is calling anew on Congress to end tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry, saying the nation needs to develop alternative sources of energy in the face of rising gasoline prices.

Obama said Saturday in his weekly radio and Internet address that he expected Congress to consider in the next few weeks halting $4 billion in tax subsidies, something he hasn't been able to get through Congress throughout his presidency. He said the vote would put lawmakers on record on whether they ""stand up for oil companies"" or ""stand up for the American people.""

""They can either place their bets on a fossil fuel from the last century or they can place their bets on America's future,"" Obama said.

Industry officials and many Republicans in Congress have argued that cutting the tax breaks would lead to higher fuel prices, raising costs on oil companies and affecting their investments in exploration and production. The measure is considered a long shot in Congress, given that Obama couldn't end the subsidies when Democrats controlled Congress earlier in his term.

Republican presidential candidates have accused Obama of delaying drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico and in a national wildlife refuge in Alaska and faulted him for not advancing the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Texas Gulf Coast refineries. They have also criticized policies pursued by the Environmental Protection Agency as inhibiting energy development.

Obama said there is no quick fix to high gas prices, which climbed to $3.83 on Friday according to AAA, but he pushed back against critics who say he is opposed to more drilling. He said the U.S. is producing more oil than at any time in the past eight years and has quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs.

""If we're truly going to make sure we're not at the mercy of spikes in gas prices every year, the answer isn't just to drill more -- because we're already drilling more,"" Obama said. He said his administration was trying to develop wind and solar power, biofuels and usher in more fuel-efficient vehicles to make the nation less dependent on oil.

In the weekly Republican address, Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said his constituents have been hard hit by an increase in gasoline prices and were ""fed up with the way the president is handling this issue, and rightfully so. The most forceful thing the president has done about high gas prices is try to explain that he's against them.""

Gardner said the $800 billion stimulus spending sought by Obama promoted energy companies that went bankrupt, wasting taxpayer money.

""After spending money we don't have on what won't work -- and overregulating what would -- is it any wonder gas prices have more than doubled on the president's watch? Make no mistake, high gas prices are a symptom of his failed `stimulus' policies,"" Gardner said.

Obama is expected to keep up a drumbeat on energy this week, traveling to four states over two days to push his administration's ""all of the above"" energy strategy. The trip includes stops in Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Ohio.",0
"Generative AI: Creating Art and Revolutionizing Technology

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that is revolutionizing the way we create art and design. This technology is used to create images, videos, music, and even text. It is being hailed as a game-changer in the world of art and technology.

The technology is based on the use of deep neural networks, which are computer systems that have the ability to learn from data. Generative AI uses these neural networks to generate new data, which can be in the form of images, videos, or even text.

One of the most impressive aspects of generative AI is its ability to create images that are indistinguishable from those created by humans. This technology has been used to create realistic-looking faces, landscapes, and even entire cities.

Another area where generative AI is making waves is in the field of music. AI-generated music has been used to create entire albums, and some musicians have even used this technology to create music that is completely unique and never before heard.

Generative AI is also being used to create text that is almost as good as that written by humans. This technology has been used to write news articles, short stories, and even novels.

The impact of generative AI on technology is equally impressive. It is being used to create self-driving cars, robots, and other intelligent systems. These systems are revolutionizing the way we live our lives and are making many tasks easier and more efficient.

Despite all these advantages, generative AI is not without its challenges. One major issue is the potential for bias. As AI is trained on data, it can sometimes inherit the biases and prejudices of the data it is trained on. This can lead to discriminatory outcomes and perpetuate inequalities.

Overall, however, generative AI is a technology that is changing the way we create art and design, and is revolutionizing the way we live our lives. As this technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see even more amazing applications in the future.",1
"Syracuse, N.Y. — Basketball coaches, prospects and their parents often talk growth potential when projecting into the performance future.

The website Draftexpress.com has gathered the measurements of 56 prospects who participated in the training camps of USA Basketball's U17 and U18 teams and posted them on their site. The interesting thing is that because plenty of these players have a history with USA Basketball, it's possible to watch their incremental growth (and yes, project whether they could get even bigger).

Several Syracuse recruits and prospects are on that list. Here's a breakdown:

The information on Malachi Richardson is curious. According to the posted measurements, he's two inches shorter than he was last year. Clearly, some sort of mistake has been made along the way. USA Basketball supposedly measured him at 6-foot-3 1/4 in shoes; he also allegedly has a 7-foot wingspan. Richardson has gained six pounds over the summer.

Tyler Lydon has grown almost an inch from last year (to 6-8.75 without shoes). He's gained 13 pounds since last summer (to a still-slender 194).

Thomas Bryant measured 6-9 and weighed 241 pounds, 20 pounds more than he weighed in the spring. He had a 7-foot-5.5 wingspan.

V.J. King, whom Syracuse recently offered a scholarship, measured 6-5 (without shoes), but had a remarkable 7-foot wingspan. And Tyus Battle, a player Syracuse coaches covet, has grown two inches in two years and stands nearly 6-7 in shoes.",0
"Machine Learning: The Next Frontier in Technology

With the rapid advancement of technology, machine learning has emerged as the next frontier in the field of computing. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables machines to learn and improve from experience, without being explicitly programmed. This technology has the potential to revolutionize industries ranging from healthcare to finance and beyond.

At its core, machine learning involves the use of algorithms to analyze large amounts of data, detect patterns and make informed decisions. The more data that is fed into the system, the better it gets at making predictions. This technology is already being used in a number of fields, including natural language processing, image and speech recognition, and predictive analytics.

One of the most exciting applications of machine learning is in healthcare. By analyzing large amounts of patient data, machine learning algorithms can help doctors and researchers identify patterns and predict outcomes, leading to more accurate diagnoses and better treatments. Machine learning is also being used to develop more effective drugs and therapies, as well as to identify potential outbreaks of infectious diseases before they become widespread.

In finance, machine learning is being used to detect fraud, predict credit risk, and make more informed investment decisions. By analyzing market data and financial indicators, machine learning algorithms can identify trends and patterns that human analysts may overlook. This technology is also being used in the development of robo-advisors, automated investment platforms that use machine learning to provide personalized investment advice to individual investors.

Despite its potential, machine learning is not without its challenges. One of the biggest obstacles is the lack of transparency in decision-making. Machine learning algorithms are often seen as a ""black box,"" making it difficult to understand how decisions are being made. This has led to concerns about bias and discrimination, particularly in areas such as hiring and lending.

Another challenge is the need for large amounts of data. Machine learning algorithms require massive amounts of data to learn and improve, which can be a significant barrier in fields where data is scarce or difficult to obtain.

Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of machine learning are too great to ignore. As this technology continues to evolve, it has the potential to revolutionize industries and transform the way we live and work. The key will be to ensure that we approach it with caution and transparency, and that we use it to improve the lives of all people, not just a privileged few.",1
"Recently, there has been a lot of attention on the educational system of Finland, a country known for its high quality education and impressive student outcomes. Finland's system has been praised for its emphasis on equity, individualized learning, and teacher professionalization.

One of the keys to Finland's success has been their emphasis on equal opportunities for all students, regardless of socioeconomic status or background. This is achieved through a comprehensive welfare system that provides children with free education, health care, and meals. Additionally, the country has a policy of integrating students with special needs into mainstream classrooms, rather than segregating them into separate schools.

Another hallmark of the Finnish educational system is its emphasis on individualized learning. Instead of standardized testing and a one-size-fits-all curriculum, students are given the freedom to pursue their interests and passions. Teachers are also given autonomy and encouraged to experiment with new teaching methods and approaches. This helps to keep education engaging and relevant for students.

Finally, Finland has a strong emphasis on teacher professionalization. Teachers are highly respected and valued in Finnish society, and the profession is considered to be one of the most important and prestigious careers. As a result, teachers are highly trained, with most holding master's degrees or higher. They are also given a great deal of trust and autonomy in their work.

Overall, the Finnish educational system serves as an impressive example of how to create a high-quality, equitable, and individualized education system. It is clear that other countries could learn much from the Finnish approach.",1
"Machine Learning: The Future of Technology

The world is constantly changing, and technology is advancing at an astonishing pace. One of the most exciting and revolutionary developments in recent years is machine learning. Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that allows computers to analyze and learn from data, improve their performance, and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. This has opened up a whole new world of possibilities, and it is changing the way we live and work.

Machine learning algorithms are already being used in a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars and personalized medicine to fraud detection and financial forecasting. In the healthcare industry, machine learning is being used to improve diagnostic accuracy, predict patient outcomes, and develop new treatments. In finance, it is used to detect fraudulent transactions and predict market trends. In retail, it is used to personalize recommendations and optimize supply chain management. The possibilities are endless.

The key to machine learning is data. The more data a machine learning algorithm has to work with, the more accurate its predictions and decisions will be. This is why companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are so successful at it. They have vast amounts of data on their users, which they use to develop highly accurate predictions and recommendations.

However, with great power comes great responsibility. Machine learning is not without its challenges. One of the biggest challenges is privacy. With so much data being collected and analyzed, there is a risk of sensitive information falling into the wrong hands. There is also a risk of the algorithm being biased if the data it is trained on is biased.

To address these challenges, it is important to have regulations and ethical guidelines in place. Companies must be transparent about what data they are collecting and how it is being used. They must also ensure that their algorithms are not biased and are free from discrimination.

In conclusion, machine learning is the future of technology. It has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, but it also comes with its challenges. As we continue to develop and refine our machine learning algorithms, it is important that we do so in an ethical and responsible manner. Only then can we truly reap the benefits of this exciting technology.",1

"Google is apparently planning to offers subsidized, commercial-grade Wi-Fi hardware to small and medium-sized businesses, The Information reports, alongside software to help greatly improve the quality of the Wi-Fi experience at places like doctors' offices, restaurants, gyms and more. The hardware would be the only cost involved, as it would use the businesses' existing Internet connections, unlike the Google-provided Wi-Fi networks running at Starbucks businesses across the U.S.

The plan is to get better Wi-Fi in the hands of these businesses in order to get more users working on Google apps and services, which ultimately means more customers spending more time engaging with Google's money-making products, even when they're away from their usual home and work Wi-Fi networks. This is the same team behind Google Fiber, the search giant's high-speed net and TV service, which is being trialled in select markets across the U.S., The Information reports.

A key feature of said network would be that it could remember a user based on their Google account login, and set them up on any other Google-controlled Wi-Fi network anywhere in the world automatically. This so-called Hotspot 2.0 feature would help in terms of clearing up the onerous task of signing in to new networks every single time. And for Google, it means getting users more friction-free access to their Google accounts and services, which has obvious benefits in terms of its ad recommendation engines and products.

Google ultimately wants to blanket the world in connectivity, because that's the best way for it to grow its user base and get its products in front of as many people as possible.

"The Educational System of Finland: A Model for the World

Finland, a small country in northern Europe, has gained a reputation for having one of the best educational systems in the world. The country consistently ranks at the top of international rankings for student performance in reading, mathematics, and science. What is the secret to Finland's success, and what can other countries learn from their educational system?

The Finnish educational system is built on a foundation of equality and inclusivity. All children, regardless of their socio-economic background, receive the same basic education. The school system is also designed to support children with special needs, with a focus on early intervention and personalized learning plans. This approach has resulted in a high level of academic performance across all socio-economic groups.

Another key feature of the Finnish educational system is the emphasis on play and creativity. Finnish schools prioritize play-based learning in the early years, allowing children to develop their social and emotional skills alongside academic ones. Schools also provide ample opportunities for art, music, and other creative pursuits, recognizing the value of these activities for both personal development and academic success.

Teachers in Finland are highly trained and respected professionals. They are required to have a master's degree in education and are given a great deal of autonomy in the classroom. This autonomy allows them to tailor their teaching methods to the needs of individual students and to prioritize creative approaches to learning.

Despite the success of the Finnish educational system, there are some challenges that remain. One issue is the lack of diversity in the teaching workforce, with a majority of teachers being white and female. There is also a need to ensure that all students have access to high-quality education, regardless of where they live in the country.

Overall, the Finnish educational system offers a model for other countries to follow. By prioritizing equality, creativity, and teacher autonomy, Finland has created a system that consistently produces high-performing students and prepares them for success in a rapidly changing world.",1
"Reaching a long-sought milestone in a bid to elevate diplomacy over war, Iran and six world powers have agreed on the parameters of a deal that strictly limits Iran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.

The breakthrough came after marathon talks marked by brinksmanship, threats, and bursts of anger from the exhausted negotiators in cloistered rooms in Lausanne's opulent Beau Rivage hotel.

Yet as details emerged late Thursday of a complex agreement to increase Iran's ""breakout time"" – the period it would take to acquire enough nuclear material for a single atomic bomb – from the current estimated 2 to 3 months to a year, the relief was palpable and the superlatives flew.

The resulting ""framework"" deal depends on a complex blend of political decisions and technical wizardry, enabling all sides to claim a degree of victory, or at least that they were not defeated. The most severe restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment capacity would be imposed for 10 years, with some measures lasting a quarter century and beyond.

But the relief on negotiators' faces masked the knowledge that an enormous amount of detailed work is still required to reach a comprehensive accord by a self-imposed June 30 deadline and overcome political challenges in both the United States and Iran.

""In the end, this success is not final, but it is a substantial achievement,"" says Ali Vaez, senior Iran analyst for the Brussels-based International Crisis Group. ""Finding a mutually acceptable formula on all the seemingly intractable issues on the table was no easy feat.""

""This is fragile, but unlike previous agreements in the past 12 years is not a short-term fix,"" says Mr. Vaez. ""Once developed into a fully-fledged agreement, this understanding can put an end to the prolonged nuclear crisis.""

In Washington, President Barack Obama hailed a ""historic understanding"" that will ""cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon."" The deal, he said, addressing skeptics, ""is not based on trust, it's based on unprecedented verification.""

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif described a ""win-win outcome"" for all sides, and Tweeted: ""Solutions found.""

""We have stopped a cycle [of escalation] that was not in the interest of anybody,"" said Mr. Zarif. ""I hope that at the end of this process, we will all show that through dialogue, and engagement with dignity, we can resolve problems.""

US Secretary of State John Kerry, whose final, record-breaking all-night session with Zarif ended at 5:53am Thursday, said gaps remained but that a ""solid foundation"" had been agreed upon to give ""confidence that Iran's nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful.""

The key calculation has eluded negotiators for years: Finding a mutually acceptable balance between the numbers and efficiency of Iran's centrifuges – and other components of its nuclear program – and how quickly and reversibly sanctions will be removed. The centrifuges are tall cylindrical machines used in a process called enrichment, in which rotors spin uranium gas at supersonic speeds to harvest the heavier isotopes useful in nuclear reactors or, at higher levels of purity, in nuclear weapons.

So what are the ""key parameters"" now meant to frame a final deal, and how far have all sides come to get there?

Centrifuges/Enrichment

Iran achieved a primary objective – implicit acceptance it could enrich uranium on its own soil – with the Geneva interim agreement of November 2013. Under that deal, which remains in force, Iran halted its most sensitive nuclear work in exchange for partial relief from sanctions.

But the current compromise is severe for both sides: Iran now has some 10,000 spinning centrifuges out of a total of 19,000 installed, and previously had insisted on keeping them all. For years the US insisted that Iran give them all up, then offered it keep a token 500.

The framework deal settles on 6,104 centrifuges installed, with 5,060 at a single site, Natanz, allowed to enrich uranium. For 10 years, Iran will only be able to use first-generation machines, with 1,000 more efficient second-generation centrifuges mothballed during that time.

A climb-down by both sides requires spin: Zarif states that ""we will continue enrichment,"" while Mr. Kerry describes ""dramatic changes"" to the ""vast majority"" of Iran's centrifuges.

Sanctions

Among the thorniest issues addressed this week by Iran and the P5+1 powers – the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany, and China – was the speed and pace of relief for Iran from a raft of United Nations, US, and European sanctions on its economy.

Iranian leaders have insisted that all sanctions be lifted ""immediately"" in any deal.",0

"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has been a major issue in the international community for over seven years now. The war began in 2014 after Ukraine's then-president, Viktor Yanukovych, was ousted from power following months of protests. This led to the annexation of Crimea by Russia and a conflict in eastern Ukraine.

The war in Ukraine has resulted in the deaths of over 13,000 people and has left many more injured or displaced. The conflict has also had a significant impact on the country's economy, with a decline in GDP and the loss of thousands of jobs.

The main parties involved in the conflict are the Ukrainian government and the separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, who are supported by Russia. Despite numerous ceasefire agreements, the fighting between the two sides has continued, with occasional spikes in violence.

In recent months, the situation in Ukraine has escalated, with Russia amassing troops along the border and in Crimea. The Ukrainian government has accused Russia of planning an invasion, while Russia claims it is only conducting military exercises.

The international community has condemned Russia's actions, with many countries calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The United States and European Union have imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response to its aggression towards Ukraine.

Despite the ongoing conflict, the people of Ukraine have shown resilience and determination. They continue to work towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict and hope for a brighter future for their country.

"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has been one of the most significant and deadly conflicts in Europe since the end of the Cold War. The origins of the conflict lie in the power struggle between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatists in the country's eastern regions.

The conflict began in 2014 when Russian-backed separatists declared independence from Ukraine, sparking a military response from the Ukrainian government. In the years since, the conflict has escalated into a full-scale war that has claimed the lives of over 13,000 people and displaced over 1.5 million.

Despite numerous ceasefires and peace talks, the violence continues to this day, with both sides accusing the other of violating the terms of the agreements. The conflict has also had a significant impact on the region's economy, with many businesses and industries suffering as a result of the fighting.

In recent years, the conflict has garnered renewed international attention, with many countries calling for an end to the violence and a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The European Union and the United States have imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response to its involvement in the conflict.

Efforts to resolve the conflict have so far been unsuccessful, with both sides refusing to compromise on their demands. The situation remains tense, with daily reports of shelling and casualties.

As the war in Ukraine drags on, it serves as a reminder of the devastating impact of conflict on people's lives and the importance of peaceful resolution to conflicts. The international community must continue to work towards a lasting solution to the crisis in Ukraine.",1
"Let us build a home automation system that can control electrical appliances such as lights, fans, gates etc suing our mobile phone from anywhere around the world. All you need is a Raspberry Pi, some relays and an android phone. Lets get started.

Components Required

Click on them to purchase from amazon

Instructions

Step 1 – The Relay

Relays are switching circuits that can close and break circuits mechanically. That means it can control an electrical circuit by closing and breaking connections in that circuit.

As you can see, there are mainly 5 terminals in a relay. Two for energizing the coil, one Common terminal, a Normally Closed terminal which will be connected to the Common terminal when the coil is not energized and a Normally Open terminal which will be in contact with the Common terminal when the coil is energized.

This is how the relay works. In our case, we will be connecting

GPIO pins to One End of Coil

Ground to other End of Coil

Phase of Main Power Supply to The Common terminal or Pole

One Terminal of bulb (Or other electrical Appliance) to Normally Open Terminal

And the Other Terminal of Bulb to Neutral Point of Main Power Supply

Since the Output of Raspberry Pi GPIO pins are 3.3V, you will have to buy a 3.3V Relay. You can purchase the relay board of 4 relays that is compatible with Raspberry Pi from here or click on the image.

Step 2 – The Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi is a low cost single board computer which can be used for robotics, home automation etc.

Get your Raspberry Pi from Here

Download and burn an OS to a micro SD card and insert it into the raspberry Pi. In this project, I used Raspbian OS. You can download the OS by clicking the below link Download

Now power it up. Now fire up your terminal and create a password for the user 'pi' by executing the command

sudo passwd pi

GPIO 11 to Relay 1 Controlling Device 1

GPIO 13 to Relay 2 Controlling Device 2

GPIO 15 to Relay 3 Controlling Device 3

GPIO 29 to Relay 4 Controlling Device 4

Step 3 – The Network

Connect your Raspberry Pi to a WiFi router or Wired network and make sure it is connected by checking whether it is getting an IP address from the switch. Connect your mobile phone to the same network and make sure there is connectivity between the mobile phone and the raspberry pi. You can confirm it by pinging your mobile phone from your Raspberry Pi by pinging to your mobile phone

ping <ip address of mobile phone>

Take a note of the IP address of the raspberry Pi as we will be using it in the future.

ifconfig

Step 4 – Connections

"One year from now, the 2012 Olympic Games will begin in London, where all eyes will be on the incomparable Usain Bolt -- the Jamaican sprinter who is more than living up to his name.

Since 2008, Bolt has taken a jackhammer to the 100-meter world record, lopping off a whopping .14 seconds. That might not sound like a huge chunk of time until you consider it's twice as much as any other sprinter has shaved off the world record since the advent of electronic scoring.

Logically, one would think that Bolt did so by moving his legs faster than anyone else. Only he didn't.

Speed, as it turns out, may be completely misunderstood.

When Bolt established the current 100-meter world record in the 2009 world championships, running it in 9.58 seconds, he did so by moving his legs at virtually the same pace as his competitors. In fact, if you or I were to compete against Bolt, our legs would turn over at essentially the same rate as his.

This is a theory put forth by academics and track coaches alike who contend that running fast has more to do with the force one applies to the ground than how quickly one can move one's legs.

More than a decade ago, Peter Weyand, a science professor at Southern Methodist University, conducted a study on speed. Comparing athletes to non-athletes, Weyand clocked both test groups as they ran at their top speed. What he found shocked him.

""The amount of time to pick up a leg and put it down is very similar,"" he says. ""It surprised us when we first figured it out.""

So if leg turnover is the same, how does one person run faster than another?

Weyand discovered that speed is dependent upon two variables: The force with which one presses against the ground and how long one applies that force.

Think of the legs as springs. The more force they can push against the ground, the further they can propel the body forward, thus maximizing the output of each individual step. In a full sprint, the average person applies about 500 to 600 pounds of force. An Olympic sprinter can apply more than 1,000 pounds.

But force isn't the only factor. How quickly that force is applied factors in as well.

For this, think of bouncing a beach ball versus a super ball. The beach ball is soft and mushy and when bounced on the ground sits for a while before slowly rebounding back into the air. Conversely, a super ball is hard and stiff and when bounced rebounds almost instantaneously -- and at a much faster speed than the beach ball.

The average person's foot is on the ground for about .12 seconds, while an Olympic sprinter's foot is on the ground for just .08 seconds -- a 33-percent difference.

""The amount of time [one's legs are] in the air is .12, regardless if you're fast or slow,"" Weyand explains. ""An elite sprinter gets the aerial time they need with less time on the ground to generate that lift -- or to get back up in the air -- because they can hit harder.""

So what makes Bolt faster than even the elite sprinters? And can he run the 100 meters even faster than 9.58 seconds?

Bolt's superiority is often explained by his unique combination of height, strength and acceleration.

At 6-foot-5, Bolt is two inches taller than fellow Jamaican Asafa Powell (pictured together below) and has six inches on American Tyson Gay -- two of his closest challengers. While it takes most elite sprinters 44 strides to complete 100 meters, Bolt does it in 41.

""Would you rather take 44 steps to your car or 41?"" asks Dan Pfaff, who coached Canada's Donovan Bailey to the 100-meter gold during the Atlanta Games in 1996.

Pfaff, now working in London to help boost Great Britain's track-and-field hopes for 2012, says Bolt's height gives him a distinct leverage advantage.

""If you're digging a hole in the ground, you have to get a longer lever to pry [out a rock],"" he explains. ""If you can control those levers and make them work efficiently, it's a huge advantage.""

It's Bolt's ability to control the levers that is so unusual for a sprinter his height.

While taller sprinters may be able to reach a higher top-end speed, getting up to that speed isn't as easy. This can be explained physiologically -- smaller people can exert more force in relation to how much they weigh -- but Weyand prefers a more simple visual to show this to be true.

""You can easily imagine a 4-foot-10 gymnast doing a triple back flip, but imagine Shaquille O'Neal or Yao Ming doing it,"" he",0
"Machine Learning: The Future of Technology

In recent years, the rise of machine learning has been undeniably one of the most significant technological advancements. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computer systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions without explicit human programming.

This technology has revolutionized various industries, including healthcare, finance, and even transportation. The possibilities for machine learning are endless, from predicting disease outbreaks to improving traffic flow in cities.

One of the most prominent applications of machine learning is in the field of predictive analytics. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data, identifying trends and patterns that humans might miss. This technology is being used in healthcare to predict and prevent disease outbreaks, in finance to identify fraudulent activities, and in marketing to predict customer preferences and behavior.

Another area where machine learning is making significant strides is in natural language processing (NLP). NLP allows computers to understand human language, enabling the development of chatbots and virtual assistants that can interact with people in a more human-like manner.

Machine learning is also becoming increasingly prevalent in the field of autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars use machine learning algorithms to identify and predict potential hazards on the road, making decisions in real-time to avoid accidents.

Despite its many benefits, machine learning is not without its challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the ethical implications of relying on machines to make decisions. The potential for bias and discrimination in machine learning algorithms is a growing concern, and researchers are working to develop more transparent and ethical models.

Overall, machine learning has the potential to transform our world in ways we have yet to imagine. With its ability to analyze vast amounts of data, predict trends, and automate decision-making processes, this technology is paving the way for a more efficient and intelligent future.",1

"Washington D.C. – The nation's capital was abuzz yesterday as a prominent politician made headlines once again with his latest move. Senator John Smith, a veteran of Capitol Hill, has been in the spotlight for his stance on various issues and his unwavering commitment to serving the American people.

Senator Smith, who has been in office for over a decade, is known for his fiery speeches and impassioned debates on the Senate floor. He is highly respected by his colleagues in Congress, both for his years of service and his sharp intellect.

But it was Smith's recent announcement that he will be running for President in the upcoming election that has captured the attention of the nation. The Senator's decision to enter the race has been met with mixed reactions, with some applauding his willingness to throw his hat in the ring, while others are skeptical about his chances of winning.

Smith's campaign platform centers around jobs, healthcare, and education. He has promised to work tirelessly to create more jobs in America, improve access to healthcare for all citizens, and reform the education system to ensure that every child has an equal opportunity to succeed.

While many believe that Smith has what it takes to win the Presidency, others are concerned about his age. At 68, the Senator would be one of the oldest Presidents to take office if he were to win the election. However, Smith has assured voters that his age is not a concern and that he has the energy and vitality needed to lead the nation.

As the race for the Presidency heats up, Senator John Smith's candidacy is sure to be closely watched by Americans across the country. His unwavering commitment to serving the people and his years of experience in politics make him a formidable opponent. The question now is whether he can convince enough voters to put him in the White House.",1

"The Educational System of Finland: A Model for the World

Finland is a country known for its excellence in education. It consistently ranks among the top countries in the world for student achievement and satisfaction, and many other countries are looking to Finland as a model for their own educational systems.

At the heart of Finland's educational success is a commitment to equity and quality. The Finnish government provides free education for all students, from early childhood through university, and there are no standardized tests or rankings. Instead, students are evaluated on their individual progress and teachers are given the autonomy to design their own curricula and assessments.

Another key feature of the Finnish system is the emphasis on play-based learning in the early years. Children start school at age 7 and spend the first few years focusing on social and emotional development, with a strong emphasis on outdoor play. This helps children develop the skills and confidence they need to succeed academically later on.

In addition to traditional classroom instruction, Finnish schools also prioritize hands-on learning and collaboration. Students are encouraged to work together on projects and research, and teachers often use real-world examples to illustrate complex concepts.

Perhaps most importantly, Finland places a strong emphasis on teacher training and support. Teaching is a highly respected profession in Finland, and teachers are required to hold a master's degree in education. They also receive ongoing professional development and support throughout their careers.

Overall, the Finnish educational system is a shining example of what can be achieved when a country prioritizes equity, quality, and innovation in education. Other countries would do well to follow Finland's lead in creating a system that supports all students in reaching their full potential.",1
"Jimmy Carter is our most unfairly reviled president since Herbert Hoover. He doesn't deserve the rap he's gotten as one of our worst presidents ever.

For many people (especially on the right), Carter is seen as a president whose weakness ruined the economy and whose appeasement destroyed America's standing in the world.

Also read: Former President Carter to be treated for cancer in his brain

To his critics, Carter is nearly the antithesis of Ronald Reagan, who defeated him in a landslide in 1980. Reagan swaggered with the certainty that he and America were infallible, while Carter was humble, thoughtful and said he cared about people, even foreigners. He was honest to a fault (which is not to say he never told a lie).

None of Carter's qualities suited him for the office of the president. He was not the strong leader we crave. But Carter's actual accomplishments in the White House are much stronger than his reputation.

The economy destroyed him, but for most of his presidency the economy performed relatively well, in some ways as well as it did under Reagan and nearly as well as under Bill Clinton.

(I'm not saying that Carter was responsible in any significant way for the economy while he was in the White House; no president is. But, by the same token, Carter shouldn't be blamed for an economy that was actually pretty good for most of his presidency.)

Economic indicators under presidents

Carter Reagan Bush 41 Clinton Bush 43 Obama Unemployment 6.5% 7.5% 6.4% 5.1% 5.4% 8.0% Jobs/month 211,000 170,000 55,000 237,000 5,000 104,000 GDP 3.4% 3.6% 2.0% 3.7% 1.5% 2.0% CPI 10.4% 4.1% 4.2% 2.6% 2.4% 1.9% Deficits/GDP -2.3% -4.2% -4.1% 0.1% -3.3% -6.2% (Average for entire time in office)

Even with a bad recession in 1980 to bring down the averages, employment rose sharply, the economy expanded at a healthy clip, personal incomes rose and federal deficits declined during Carter's four years in office.

Of the presidents who've served in the past 40 years, only Clinton's presidency saw faster job growth than Carter's, and only Clinton had lower federal deficits.

Carter also took the first steps in deregulating the economy — such as the trucking, airlines, energy and banking industries — and was the first to propose that the United States ought to have an energy policy that would include strong conservation efforts and renewable energy sources.

And Carter's foreign policy was more positive than he's given credit for. He's the only president of his century who never deployed combat troops overseas. He negotiated the Camp David accord to end hostilities between Egypt and Israel, signed an important nuclear-arms-control treaty with the Soviets, and returned the Panama Canal to the Panamanians.

However, inflation soared out of control during Carter's term, and that was his ultimate undoing.

Unlike most presidents, Carter didn't kick the can down the road until after the next election (and there is always a next election). He did something about the nation's biggest problem, even though it cost him a second term.

Carter appointed Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve in October 1979, just a year before the election, with the explicit mandate of whipping the inflation that had been plaguing the economy for a decade. Almost immediately, Volcker began to raise interest rates to wring inflation and inflationary expectations out of the economy. The discount rate went to 13% in February 1980, and yields on 2-year Treasurys hit 15.4% in March.

It worked. Volcker ultimately threw the economy into a severe double-dip recession, but that harsh medicine cured us of the double-digit inflation rates. Carter never interfered with Volcker's independence — unlike Reagan, who tried to bully Volcker into softening his anti-inflation stance.

Something else happened in 1979 that contributed to the recession and to Carter's defeat in the 1980 election: Iran's revolution, which reduced that country's production of petroleum and contributed to the brutal stagflation of 1979 and 1980.

And here we see the strength and weakness of Carter's character. The shah of Iran was deposed in a popular revolution in 1978. He'd been one of America's more thuggish allies in the preceding two decades, but Carter, who believed the U.S. should act with moral authority in the world, never liked him much and refused to prop him up against his own people.

Carter began to deal with the new post-shah Iranian government. Relations were improving until Carter made a fateful",0

"By Robert Mullin

CAISO last week provided an explanation of its decision to increase regulation requirements in response to the growing variability on its system.

The ISO's Department of Market Monitoring last month called attention to the sharp rise in costs from the requirements, prompting the California Energy Commission to ask the ISO to justify the move. (See CAISO Regulation Costs Quadruple as Price, Procurement Jump.)

During a Market Performance and Planning Forum last week, CAISO said it doubled its frequency regulation service requirement from late February to mid-June in response to recurring short-term generation forecasting errors stemming from variable wind and solar resources during late winter and spring.

The forecasting problem is mostly isolated to spring, when high renewable output often coincides with periods of low loads in California. At the same time, weather patterns tend to be more erratic, often making it especially difficult to predict renewable output on a moment-to-moment basis.

Regulation prices more than doubled shortly after the ISO increased its daily regulation procurement from 400 MW or less to as much as 800 MW in late February. Daily payments to regulation service providers surged from $100,000 to more than $400,000, the ISO's Monitor found last month.

The ISO rolled back regulation requirements to previous levels for summer because of more predictable weather patterns.

Further compounding the spring forecasting issue is the increasing adoption of residential rooftop solar, which is subject to the same variability as utility-scale projects. The ISO estimates it has nearly 5,000 MW in rooftop solar in its balancing area, with new installations added daily. Variability in behind-the-meter rooftop output complicates matters by causing loads to skew from forecasts depending on whether the sun is shining.

The problem ""happens more in the off-season — with more of the clouds coming in,"" said Amber Motley, CAISO short-term forecasting manager. ""Timing and forecasting of [generation] ramps are very difficult. Forecasting cloud coverage is difficult.""

Variable wind production can also be a factor, with cold fronts making it difficult to predict the timing of wind ramps and changes in wind direction causing intermittency.

Clyde Loutan, ISO senior advisor for renewable energy integration, said weather changes can occur too quickly to incorporate revised forecasts into the real-time market run. He also pointed out that forecasting errors are not covered under the ISO's real-time contingency dispatch process, which sets aside generation to allow the system to recover from major disturbances.

""So you have to rely on regulation,"" Loutan said.

""Seems like it's more a failure of the forecast,"" said Dan Williams, CAISO markets analyst at Portland General Electric. ""And that should be changed by changing the market rather than rolling it into regulation.""

Loutan countered that he didn't know of any forecaster that could reflect the intermittency in the five-minute market.

""When you think about how these markets were designed, they were really designed for conventional units,"" he said.

Loutan also pointed to a clear financial incentive driving the ISO's increased requirement.

""Back in January we had some pretty bad days when we didn't control the frequency well enough,"" he said. ""For 11 hours, we had a hard time controlling the system. We found out that we were running out of regulation.""

If the condition had persisted longer than 30 consecutive minutes, the ISO would have been subject to as much as $1 million in NERC penalties, he said.

Carolyn Kehrein, principal consultant for the Energy Users Forum, suggested that increased regulation costs should be allocated to intermittent resources if the forecasting problem continued and the ISO didn't develop new tools to deal with it. She said increased costs for intermittency should encourage the ""right kind"" of renewable development, such as geothermal.

Wei Zhou, senior project manager with Southern California Edison, agreed with applying the cost-causation principle to the problem.

""This is something that we're looking at long-term,"" said Loutan, referring to the forecasting issue at large. ""But for now we just wanted to explain why we increased our regulation procurement.""",0
"RFP issued for management coaching after article revealed that previous contract award was made in violation of trade laws

N

anaimo city officials quietly cancelled a widely publicized management training program after being embarrassed by aexposé, it emerged yesterday.

Officials failed to tell the public for nine weeks that the controversial program was scrapped due to the fallout over the article, which said the contract had been awarded in violation of trade laws because it wasn't put out for bids.

The article also revealed that one of the instructors the city was hiring ran a $500-per-night sexual empowerment retreat.

A news release on the city's website still says the program is proceeding, but yesterday the city issued a request for proposals (RFP) inviting other companies to bid on the contract.

At a closed-door meeting on Oct. 2, city manager Tracy Samra got councillors to approve the ""Constructive Culture through Self-Leadership"" training sessions for about 50 managers.

They awarded the contract to Coach Associates International, a home-based business operated by Vancouver Island University (VIU) business professor Dr. Steven Purse.

Two days later, Ms. Samra issued the news release about the program but didn't disclose how much the contract was worth. She said the program was meant to fix the city's toxic culture, and she was ""convinced that this is the path forward.""

However, on Saturday Oct. 7 of the Thanksgiving weekend News Nanaimo revealed that the city had violated the NewWest Partnership trade agreement because the contract was worth more than $75,000 but was not advertised for competitive bids.

The article also disclosed that Dr. Purse's partner in the program, Brad Switnicki, offered an apartment on Nanaimo's waterfront for rent as a ""sexually empowering retreat adventure.""

VIU president gets involved

The news caused embarrassment for not only city council, but was also a source of concern for senior executives at VIU.

Records obtained through a freedom of information request show that VIU's president Dr. Ralph Nilson emailed senior managers about the issue when he returned to work on the Tuesday morning following the long weekend.

The subject of his message was marked ""Confidential:Any questions re: VIU faculty and individual contract.""

Shelley Legin, the university's chief financial officer and vice-president of administration, then asked her communications manager Janina Stajic to ""please prepare for this and monitor social media.""

The records show that there were more than a dozen other emails that day, most raising concerns about information highlighted on Facebook showing a link from VIU's website to Dr. Purse's company website. That link was removed.

Meanwhile, at the city, councillors were irate when they were informed that Dr. Purse's company and the city would not be proceeding with their agreement.

It's not known who initiated the decision to cancel the contract.

Records show that when News Nanaimo later asked VIU if they had or would be taking action to distance the university from the contract, Ms. Stajic emailed her boss to say, ""PS if we aren't able to respond that is okay.""

The university never did answer any questions about the contract or its policies for freelance work by faculty.

No records kept

According to VIU's policy on outside employment activities, the president is required to keep a ""record of all regular employee's (sic) ongoing business interests and outside contracts of employment.""

However, in response to a freedom of information request for the records, VIU last week admitted there were none.

""We confirm that the VIU does not currently maintain a universal register of all employees' outside business interests. As we assume that this request is in relation to your recent published article concerning a consulting arrangement between a member of the Faculty of Management at VIU and the City of Nanaimo, we have also confirmed that this Faculty does not maintain such a master list,"" said the response.

Samra: ""Change will continue""

In its new RFP yesterday, the city said it was seeking proposals from ""qualified firms experienced in coaching, training and/or education to facilitate leadership and corporate culture change for City of Nanaimo management.""

The year-long contract will deliver coaching services to about 60 members of the city's management reporting directly or indirectly to Ms. Samra.

In an email to all staff this week, Ms. Samra said: ""I recognize the City of Nanaimo is going through some challenging times. We have been in a period of change management for two years. And, change will continue into the future.""

She said she had met with about 50 management staff to ""talk about a leadership and change management program.""

The plan was for the management group ""to lead us through corporate culture change",0

Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and the NRA are targeting 14 bills. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) Story Highlights The NRA spent $700,000 on federal lobbying during first three months of the year

The NRA has spent $125,000 more on lobbying this year than it did during the first quarter of 2012

Monday is the deadline to submit reports on lobbying activity

WASHINGTON – The National Rifle Association stepped up its lobbying activity during the first three months of the year, spending $700,000 as it sought to fend off new efforts to pass gun-safety legislation, new lobbying reports show.

By comparison, the NRA spent $575,000 on lobbying during the first three months of 2012.

Among the 14 bills targeted by NRA's lobbyists: proposals to ban assault-style weapons and to expand background checks for gun purchases – measures pushed by President Obama following last December's shootings that killed 26 children and educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

USA TODAY POLL: Public support for gun control ebbs

The Senate last week failed to pass a measure prohibiting assault weapons or a compromise bill to strengthen background checks, both of which the NRA opposed. Senators did approve amendments that seek to limit the public release of gun-ownership information and that encourage mental-health awareness and school-violence prevention efforts.

Monday is the deadline for interest groups, companies and others with business before the federal government to submit reports, detailing their lobbying activity during the first quarter of the year.

As of midafternoon, new lobbying reports had not been filed on behalf of the leading gun-control groups, including Americans for Responsible Solutions, a new group led by former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head while meeting with constituents in January 2011. The group recently hired two lobbying firms to advance its agenda on Capitol Hill.

In the past, gun-control advocates have failed to match the NRA's spending. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, for instance, spent $40,000 on lobbying last year – an amount dwarfed by the $2.5 million spent by the NRA in 2012.

The NRA's filing shows it employs 12 in-house lobbyists, including its highly visible executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre.

"Machine Learning: The Future of Technology

In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a pivotal technology that has revolutionized various industries. From healthcare to finance, retail to transportation, machine learning has been applied in numerous fields to automate complex processes, improve accuracy, and enhance decision-making.

But what exactly is machine learning? It is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms are designed to identify patterns and trends in data, and use this knowledge to make predictions or decisions.

One of the most common applications of machine learning is in the field of predictive analytics. Companies use machine learning algorithms to analyze large volumes of data and identify patterns that could indicate future trends. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to predict which products are likely to be popular in the coming months, or which customers are likely to churn.

Another area where machine learning is making an impact is in the field of natural language processing. By analyzing vast amounts of text data, machine learning algorithms can understand the nuances of language and identify sentiment, topic, and intent. This technology is used in chatbots, virtual assistants, and other applications that require computers to understand human language.

In healthcare, machine learning is being used to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. Algorithms are being developed to predict which patients are at risk of developing certain conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, so that preventative measures can be taken. Machine learning is also being used to analyze medical images, such as X-rays and MRI scans, to improve accuracy in diagnosis.

Despite its many benefits, machine learning also raises ethical concerns. One of the biggest concerns is the potential for biases to be built into algorithms. If the data used to train machine learning models is biased, the resulting algorithms will also be biased. This could lead to discriminatory outcomes, such as denying loans to certain groups based on their race or gender.

In conclusion, machine learning is a powerful technology that has the potential to transform various industries. However, it is important to ensure that the ethical implications of this technology are carefully considered. As machine learning continues to evolve, it will be important to strike a balance between innovation and responsibility.",1

"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has been a major concern for the international community for nearly a decade now. The conflict started in 2014 when protests erupted in Ukraine following the ousting of the then-president, Viktor Yanukovych. Russia, which has always seen Ukraine as its sphere of influence, seized the opportunity to annex Crimea and support separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.

Since then, the conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives, displaced over 1.5 million people, and caused significant damage to infrastructure in the region. Despite numerous ceasefire agreements, the fighting has continued and the situation remains volatile.

The conflict is not only a humanitarian crisis but also a geopolitical one. Russia’s actions in Ukraine have raised concerns about its intentions towards its neighbors and its commitment to international law. The annexation of Crimea was a clear violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as international law.

The international community, including the United Nations and the European Union, has imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine. Diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict have also been ongoing, but progress has been slow.

The conflict in Ukraine is a reminder of the importance of respecting international law and the sovereignty of nations. It also highlights the need for effective conflict resolution mechanisms to prevent such conflicts from escalating and causing further suffering to people in the region.

The international community must continue to support Ukraine in its efforts to restore peace and stability in the region. This includes providing humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict and supporting diplomatic efforts to find a lasting solution to the crisis.",1
"Washington D.C. - Senator John Smith, a prominent member of the United States Senate, has recently gained attention for his controversial remarks on immigration policy.

In a recent interview with a national news outlet, Senator Smith stated that he believes all illegal immigrants should be deported immediately, regardless of their circumstances or length of time spent in the United States.

These remarks have sparked outrage among immigrant rights activists, who argue that such a plan would be both inhumane and impractical.

Senator Smith, however, has stood by his statements, claiming that his primary concern is the safety and security of American citizens.

The senator, who has been a member of the Senate for over a decade, has a reputation for being a staunch conservative and a vocal advocate for conservative values.

While his immigration comments have garnered attention in recent weeks, Senator Smith has also been at the forefront of efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and has been a vocal critic of the Obama administration's foreign policy initiatives.

Despite his controversial views, Senator Smith remains a respected and influential member of Congress, and his opinions are often sought after by members of both parties.

As the immigration debate continues to heat up in Washington, it remains to be seen how Senator Smith's comments will affect the conversation going forward.",1
"The war in Ukraine has been ongoing since 2014 and has resulted in the loss of thousands of lives. This conflict began when Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula, and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine declared independence. The Ukrainian government responded by launching an offensive against the separatists, leading to a full-scale war.

The conflict has had a devastating impact on the people of Ukraine, with many forced to flee their homes and communities torn apart by violence and displacement. The war has also had severe economic consequences, with Ukraine's economy suffering as a result of the conflict.

Despite numerous ceasefire agreements, the fighting has continued, and the situation remains tense. Both sides have been accused of human rights violations, including the use of torture, extrajudicial killings, and the targeting of civilian populations.

International efforts to resolve the conflict have so far been unsuccessful, with Russia denying involvement in the conflict and insisting that it is an internal matter for Ukraine. The United Nations and other international organizations have called for an end to the violence and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

As the fighting continues, the people of Ukraine remain caught in the middle, with their lives and livelihoods at risk. It is crucial that the international community continues to work towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict, in order to bring an end to the suffering of the Ukrainian people.",1

"First, I really don't care if you know the OP personally -- regardless of the intent of the post, the discussion has moved on and there is a general topic at hand now: and that is that players like this, who knowingly exploit the system, don't deserve their rank and should be ashamed of themselves.

Are you personally offended that everyone assumes your friend is carried garbage? You shouldn't be. It's a fairly normal assumption to make when one is clearly carried.

He may be a great Mercy. GM level even. But for his rank, since it was gained through an exploitation of the system, he wouldn't survive in a solo queue against top 500s. Thus, boosted garbage compared to those of similar (and well earned) rank. This is certainly an apt discussion to have when someone 'jokingly' brags about their rank, since they don't even deserve to be there in the first place. In any case, what do you even care about people getting 'off topic' if it was 'all a meme bro'?

Plus, that just gives us more insight into his character -- Bragging about his #1 rank to 'get people mad', when he knowingly cheated his way to that spot, makes him a pretty garbage person too. It doesn't matter if it's a 'meme' or a 'troll' (which is frankly unbelievably pathetic 12 year old behavior, geez) -- the discussion got real pretty quick when he was found out for his methods and now ya'll just can't handle being called out for the trash that you are now.

"Scientists Make Breakthrough Discovery in Cancer Research

In a groundbreaking development, a team of scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) have discovered a new approach to treating cancer that has the potential to revolutionize cancer therapy.

The researchers found that by inhibiting this protein, they were able to significantly reduce the growth of cancer cells in the lab.

“This is a major breakthrough in cancer research,” said Dr. Smith. “We’ve been studying PAK4 for a long time, and we’ve known that it plays a critical role in cancer. But until now, we haven’t had a way to effectively target it.”

"Mathematics: Unlocking the Secrets of the Universe

Mathematics, often considered a daunting subject by many, plays a crucial role in our daily lives. From calculating the tip at a restaurant to designing complex buildings and bridges, mathematics is the foundation of modern life. But beyond everyday applications, this subject also holds the key to understanding the secrets of the universe.

Mathematics has been around for thousands of years, with early civilizations using it for basic counting and measuring. However, it was not until the 17th century that mathematics began to be studied in-depth as a discipline in itself. Since then, mathematicians have made groundbreaking discoveries that have changed the course of human history.

One of the most significant contributions of mathematics is its ability to explain natural phenomena. For example, Isaac Newton’s laws of motion, which were based on mathematical formulas, allowed us to understand the mechanics of the universe. Similarly, Einstein's theory of relativity, which relies heavily on advanced mathematics, revolutionized our understanding of space and time.

Mathematics has also played a vital role in the technological advancements of our time. It has enabled the development of computers, smartphones, and other digital devices that we use in our daily lives. The algorithms that power these devices are based on mathematical principles, allowing them to perform complex calculations at lightning speed.

Despite its importance, mathematics is still a subject that many people fear and struggle with. This is partly due to the way it is taught in schools, which often focuses on memorizing formulas rather than understanding the concepts behind them. However, there is a growing movement to change this perception and make mathematics more accessible and engaging.

In conclusion, mathematics is not just a subject to be studied in school, but it is an essential tool for unlocking the secrets of the universe and shaping the world we live in. It is time to give this subject the attention and respect it deserves, and we must encourage more people to embrace it and explore its wonders.",1
"One of Obamacare's biggest selling points for women is the guarantee of no-cost birth control, a new benefit that includes all forms of contraception from the pill to tubal ligation.

But two years after the rules eliminating copayments for contraceptives took effect, some women are still forking over cash to the pharmacist when they pick up their pills or at the doctor's office when they obtain other forms of birth control.

Just last week, CVS announced it would send rebates to 11,000 women who were erroneously charged for their birth control pills at the company's stores because of a computer error. The snafu came to light when an aide to Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) had to pay $20 for birth control at a Washington CVS, which prompted an inquiry by the lawmaker.

So did President Barack Obama break a promise? Are health insurance companies and drugstores picking women's pockets?

The good news is that neither of those things is true, and eventually almost all women with health coverage won't have to pay a dime when they obtain contraceptives. The bad news is that it's a little complicated. Because of course it is. This is the American health care system, after all.

""American women don't really know what all the rules are,"" said Judy Waxman, vice president for health and reproductive rights at the National Women's Law Center. ""All this is relatively new, and it's working fairly well. It just needs to be cleaned up and work better.""

Some health insurance plans aren't yet required to comply with this part of Obamacare. Others never will have to cover birth control, such as those plans provided to employees of religious organizations. And as the CVS example illustrates, sometimes insurers and pharmacists just get it wrong, and women have to jump through hoops to set it straight.

""We do hear from women all over the country with what I will call glitches,"" Waxman said. ""Not everybody understands what they're supposed to be doing.""

First, the basics: The Affordable Care Act does require health insurance companies to cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptives -- including the pill, IUDs, the ring and the patch -- without any form of cost-sharing like copayments or deductibles. This requirement comes from the same part of the law that mandates no charges for preventive medicine, such as immunizations and cholesterol tests.

If you receive your health benefits from an employer and you're not sure whether you have to pay out-of-pocket to get contraception, you should ask a manager, the human resources office or the insurance company. If you buy health insurance on your own, check with the plan to find out what your contraceptive coverage is. All health insurance sold on the Obamacare exchanges includes no-cost birth control. If your insurance company still insists you owe copayments, you might have to file an appeal, Waxman said.

If you don't get straight answers from your employer or insurance provider, or if you feel like you're being ripped off, organizations such as the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and the National Women's Law Center can help, as can state insurance commissioners and the U.S. Department of Labor, Waxman said.

Despite its shortcomings and the confusion around how it's supposed to work, the Obamacare birth control mandate has had a huge impact: Many, many more women have access to no-cost contraception than before the law took effect, as this chart from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization, shows.


Source: The Guttmacher Institute

The share of women who obtained oral contraceptives without copayments rose from 15 percent in 2012 to 67 percent this year, according to a survey by the Guttmacher Institute. Women who used an injectable contraceptive or the ring saw a similarly major improvement in their benefits, and those using IUDs saw a somewhat smaller increase.

The effect on women's pocketbooks is striking: Women using contraceptives saved $483 million in copayments last year, according to IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, a branch of IMS Health that tracks pharmaceutical sales. (Obamacare didn't exactly make contraceptives ""free,"" of course, because their cost now just gets included in the overall insurance cost.) The number of prescriptions filled for the pill also increased by 4.6 percent from the year before, IMS reported in April.

Top bar in millions of prescriptions. Bottom bar in millions of dollars. Source: IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics

That's probably a big reason why this part of Obamacare is so popular. In a survey conducted this July, 60 percent of people said they supported mandated no-cost birth control, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found. Still, one-third of Americans didn't know about the no-cost birth control benefit as recently as March, and only one-fifth said they'd heard a lot about it",0
"Bill Gates is taking on a bigger role at Microsoft. He's stepping down from his position as chairman today and will take up the role of technology advisor to Microsoft's new CEO, Satya Nadella.

""I'll have over a third of my time available to meet with product groups, and it'll be fun to define this next round of products working together.""

""The opportunity for Microsoft is greater than ever before.""

Though Gates has regularly stated that he'd prefer to spend more of his time working on philanthropic projects than Microsoft, Nadella is said to have requested Gates' assistance while stepping into his new role. Gates says that Nadella has the right background to lead Microsoft forward, explaining that Microsoft has large opportunities ahead of it in mobile and cloud computing — the latter an area that Nadella has plenty of experience in.

Gates will be succeeded as chairman by John Thompson, who joined Microsoft's board in February of 2012. Thompson is currently the CEO of Virtual Instruments and previously served as CEO and chairman of Symantec. Thompson's appointment also marks a major change for Microsoft: Gates has served as the company's chairman since 1981, well before he stepped down as CEO.

"Generative AI: Revolutionizing the Future of Technology

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly advancing field of technology that is changing the way we interact with machines. Generative AI is a type of machine learning that uses algorithms to create new data that is similar to the original data it was trained on. This technology has the potential to revolutionize industries such as healthcare, entertainment, and education.

One of the most exciting applications of generative AI is in the field of healthcare. Medical researchers can use generative AI to create new drugs and treatments for diseases such as cancer. By training the algorithm on data from previous successful treatments, generative AI can create new drugs that have a higher chance of success. This technology has the potential to save countless lives and improve the quality of care for patients.

Generative AI is also being used in the entertainment industry to create new forms of media. For example, Deepfake technology uses generative AI to create realistic videos of famous people saying and doing things they never actually did. While this technology has raised concerns about the potential for misinformation and the ability to manipulate public opinion, it also has the potential to create new forms of entertainment and storytelling.

In the field of education, generative AI can be used to create personalized learning experiences for students. By analyzing data on student performance and learning styles, generative AI algorithms can create individualized lesson plans and exercises that cater to each student's needs. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach education and ensure that each student receives the education they need to succeed.

Despite its potential benefits, generative AI also raises concerns about its potential misuse. For example, it can be used to create fake news, deepfakes, and other forms of misinformation that can harm individuals, organizations, and even entire countries. As with any new technology, it is important to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits before implementing it.

In conclusion, generative AI is a powerful technology that has the potential to reshape our world. From healthcare to entertainment and education, this technology has the potential to improve our lives in countless ways. However, it is important to approach this technology with caution and consideration to ensure that it is used in ethical and responsible ways.",1
"In a groundbreaking article T. L. Freeman discusses the relationship between actual age and effective age. His conclusion is that the passing of the years goes faster as we grow older. This makes sense; for instance when you are 10 years of age , a year represents 10% of your life , and seems like a very long time. However, when you are 50 years old, one year has reduced to only 2% of your life, and hence seems only one-fifth as long.

Summarizing this work, Freeman comes to the conclusion that the actual age (AA) needs to be corrected for the apparent length of a year (AY). The apparent length of a year is inversely proportional to one person's actual age:

AY= α /AA

The constant of proportionality α is rather loosely defined by Freeman as the age at which a year really seems to last a year, and it was arbitrarily set at 20 years ( α =20).

Now Freeman determines the concept of Effective age, which is simply the integral over time of the Apparent Year from age 1 to the actual age (AA) of interest:

AA AA EA = ∫ AY d(AA) = ∫ 20/AA d(AA) = 20 ln(AA) 1 1

Although this formula results in some interesting conclusions, there are several flaws with this concept. As mentioned above, the choice of the proportionality constant is rather arbitrary . There is no rational justification for the choice of this age, but it was solely chosen based on Freeman's own perception of (the passing of) time. Next, the evaluation of the integral seems incorrect, since its lower limit was set at 1, and not at 0. Obviously, the choice of zero as lower integration boundary yields can not be evaluated due to the logarithmic term in the expression. Because of the obvious problems with Freeman's concept of time perception , it is necessary to redefine the Effective Age on a sounder basis.

In the traditional concept of time perception, one person's Actual Age is proportional to the passing of time (t).

AA = β t + γ

Note the occurrence of two parameters β and γ that are traditionally set to one and zero, respectively. However, each has a clear (though usually underappreciated) function in time perception. The β -parameter describes the rate at which one person ages; some persons remain annoying little crybabies during their life, while others become boring old farts at 20. The γ -parameter describes the origin of one person's time perception. Did you ever meet those proud parents boasting about their little one who is only x months old, and already walks, writes obfuscated C, or recently sold his first dot.com? No, these youngsters aren't bright for their age; they simply have a high γ -factor.

It is clear that with this definition, one person's Actual Age may already be non-synchronous with time. However, analogous to Freeman's work, the apparent length of a year (AY) is not constant:

AY= α /AA = α /( β t + γ )

δ

ε

AY= α /( β t + γ ) = ( α / β )/(t + γ / β ) = δ /(t + ε )

δ

ε

We can remove one of the parameters by defining two parametersandThe actual values ofandwill become clear from the boundary conditions

In order to obtain the Effective Age, the integral of AY is evaluated. Note that the integral is evaluated over time, and not over Actual Age, since AA is a function of time:

t t EA = ∫ AY d(t) = ∫ δ /(t + ε ) d(t) 0 0 EA = δ ln(t + ε ) - δ ln( ε )

The lower boundary condition (t=0) should yield an Effective Age of zero years (EA=0). Therefore= 1.

The upper boundary is less apparent. It should be chosen so that at t=t max , EA = t. At death, the Effective Age and real time are again equal. However, no person knows for sure his or her personal life expectancy. This is clearly an issue for molecular biologists to address.

"About

""Did You Just Assume My Gender?"" is a punchline used to mock the sensitivity of feminists, Social Justice Warriors, and the discussions going on in the LGBTQ community, particularly the Trans and Queer communities, involving gender identification.

Origin

In online discussions, a vocal community of people who identified as genderqueer or genderfluid (neither a boy or girl) grew on Tumblr and certain subreddits as part of Social Justice Blogging and increased awareness surrounding gender issues. ""Did You Just Assume My Gender?"" first appeared as a punchline mocking the supposedly militant nature of feminists and queer activists in a May 1st, 2016 post on Imgur by JCMorrowx.


Spread

""Did You Just Assume My Gender?"" soon became a punchline associated with Triggered memes and social justice warriors. On May 29th, 2016, a thread on Reddit's /r/OutofTheLoop asked ""What's with people and their gender identities lately?"" The top comment read:

""The gist of it is that once transgender people started to become more socially acceptable, it suddenly became cool (on tumblr at least) to pretend you were transgender or at the very least not bound to just one gender. As a result, certain people started to state the pronouns they wished to be assigned to them (i.e.ce/cir/cirs/cirself instead of he/him/his/himself) and lead to people complaining about being refered to as male or female.""

Over the course of the summer, ""Did You Just Assume My Gender?"" jokes trended on 9gag and ifunny. Another thread on /r/OutOfTheLoop appeared on August 24th, this time asking ""Where did Did you just assume my gender? come from?""

Cyberpunk 2077 Twitter Controversy

On August 20th, 2018, Twitter user @rysteez replied to a tweet posted by the official Twitter feed for the upcoming game Cyberpunk 2077 with the message ""I want more guys,"" to which the @CyberpunkGam e feed responded ""Did you just assume their gender?"" (shown below).


Following the tweet, several Twitter users accused the @CyberpunkGame feed of using a transphobic joke, while others argued the joke was not transphobic (shown below).


On August 21st, the @CyberpunkGame feed posted an apology for the tweet, stating that ""harming anyone was never our intention"" (shown below).

"UPDATE – 3rd Dec: We have obtained a copy of the RFEOI document and have reuploaded it here on our website. See updated link below.

UPDATE – 7th Oct: we have contacted TransLink regarding the RFEOI document source, which has been taken down and is currently unavailable on their website.

The South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority (""TransLink"") has just recently released an RFEOI (Request for Expression of Interest) for the supply of new fully-automated vehicles for the SkyTrain system; the delivery of the new cars will coincide with the entrance of Evergreen Line service in 2016. View the document now:

Among the important details in this RFEOI are the initial purposes stated in PART A:

2.2 – TransLink intends to procure up to an initial 28 Vehicles (actual number of Vehicles may be increased or

decreased at TransLink's discretion), with potential options for up to an additional 28 Vehicles (actual

number of Vehicles may be increased or decreased at TransLink's discretion). The anticipated service

dates for the initial Vehicles is approximately January 2016, and June 2017 for optional Vehicles. 2.3 – Vehicles must be compatible with the existing SkyTrain infrastructure (guideways and stations), technology

(ALRT and Steerable Axle Trucks), propulsion power systems (Linear Induction Motors powered by 650

Volts DC), and SELTRAC automated train control system. Refer to the system overview provided in

Appendix 1 and Vehicle Dimensions listed in Appendix 2.

The deliveries of the initial 28 vehicle orders will coincide with the arrival of Evergreen Line SkyTrain service in 2016 and an additional 28 vehicles may enter service in 2017. It is conceivable that thew new vehicles will be using the newest Bombardier Innovia Metro 300 specification designed by Bombardier in 2010.

Among the interesting portions of the document and perhaps the most prominent is ""APPENDIX 2"", which details the technical specifications that the new vehicles must meet.

This portion of the document reveals important details about the configuration of the new trains. It specifies that there is a ""centre car"" (a vehicle insertion between two end vehicles) as well as that the number of cars in a basic unit is to equal 4. This points to the fact that while the individual vehicles themselves will be of simlar length, the new vehicles will be arranged in a 4-car articulated configuration which will be connected and walkable from end-to-end. If they were just married pairs, as with the current ART 200 configs, there wouldn't be any ""centre cars"" – they would all be ""end cars"". With TransLink is attempting to maximize per-train capacity, ensuring that all ART 200 (Mark II) trains operate with a 4-car configuration (2x 2-car married pair), this specification does make sense. Up to 56 of these new cars may be in service by summer of 2017.

At present there are only two other Bombardier Innovia ART systems in the world using 4-car long vehicles, being the implementations to exist in Beijing, China and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

It is highly likely that the new SkyTrain vehicles will be inserted into service on the busier Expo Line segments as opposed to the Evergreen Line, as it is planned that the Evergreen Line will begin service with 2-car configuration Mk II trains at 3 minute frequencies during the peak hours.

Curiously the vehicle dimension requirements outlined in the article have closer conformation to existing-generation ART 200 series SkyTrain cars. However, this should not forego the possibility of newest generation Bombardier Innovia Metro 300 cars being ordered (Innovia ART 300 spec sheet: see source 61). Metro 300 cars still confirm to these specs, but are also slightly shorter and lighter.

Under the Metro 300 specification, each car will carry 134 passengers with a 4 passengers/m2 passenger density or 185 passengers with a 6 passengers/m2 crush-load passenger density. Up to 740 (with a 6 passengers/m2 density) people can be carried per 4-car vehicle of this next generation of the SkyTrain fleet – and owing to the extra articulated sections between cars which can actually hold passengers themselves, this number may be higher so.

——————————————————————————

This choice will present some interesting opportunities for TransLink. The vehicles will be similar to the ART 200 configuration used on the newer generation SkyTrain cars of today, which are almost always used in a 4-car vehicle configuration. TransLink has an opportunity to add a 5th centre car to expand the new trains to a 5-car config.

A SkyTrain segment that can be expected to feature a headway of 75 seconds (the theoretical maximum possible headway) with exclusive use of 5-car variant ART 300 trains (i.e. the segment between Columbia and Waterfront Stations) has",0
"Historically, most web designers and their clients have approached the desktop side of any project first, while leaving the mobile part as a secondary goal that gets accomplished later. Even with the rise of responsive design, many of us begin with the ""full size"" site and work our way down.

There's a growing trend in the industry though to flip this workflow on its head and actually begin with mobile considerations and then work up to a larger desktop version. Why would you ever approach a project this way? What are some of the pros and cons of this strategy? Read on to find out!

This article is part of our series on ""looking beyond desktop design"", brought to you in partnership with Heart Internet VPS.

Mobile Web Design Isn't a Niche

If you still have it in your head that mobile web design and application development is a niche industry, you need to change your way of thinking. Mobile isn't a trend, nor is it even the future, it's the present. Don't believe me? Here are some crazy statistics to consider from Mobithinking from last month.

There are over 1.2 billion mobile web users worldwide

mobile web users worldwide In the U.S., 25% of mobile Web users are mobile-only (they rarely use a desktop to access the web)

Mobile apps have been downloaded 10.9 billion times

Mobile device sales are increasing across the board with over 85 percent of new handsets able to access the mobile Web

One of the most potent facts here is the second item, which brings to light that many users will likely only ever see the mobile version of your site. That's an astounding revelation isn't it?

More than ever before the web is something that we carry in our pockets, not something that merely hangs out near our desk or even in our homes. This is a global trend that will only continue to see growth in the coming years. Are you ready for this? Does your professional skill set include web development for all important platforms or just the desktop arena?

Why Mobile First?

Odds are none of the people reading this have learned anything new up to this point. The $200+ phones in the pockets of everyone you know are all the indication you need that the web has broken out of its computer shaped box.

However, the fact that mobile web access is popular does almost nothing to convince me that I need to pursue a strategy that actually puts mobile first. The flip side of 25% of mobile users being mobile-only is that 75% of them aren't! Obviously, the desktop is still an important medium, not to be forgotten or pushed to the back burner quite yet. So why are we even considering taking the mobile first route?

One of the major catalysts for the rise of mobile first web design was the announcement from Eric Schmidt in 2010 that Google was going to be taking this approach from now on, going so far as to say ""I think it's now the joint project of all of us to make mobile the answer to pretty much everything"" (source). Why this drastic change in approach?

Graceful Degradation vs. Progressive Enhancement

These are some major buzz words from a few years ago that can still lend a lot of insight into the notion of mobile first web design and why it's an important concept to consider.

Graceful degradation arose out of a need to have a design function on as many browsers and platforms as possible. Designers and developers wanted to take advantage of new technology without excluding users with setups that didn't have support. The general conclusion was to create and serve up the best experience possible, and then account for each possible degradation and ensure that despite any shortcomings, the site would remain functional.

In terms of mobile web design, this meant that a full, standard website would scale back and gradually remove content and features as the viewport became smaller and the system simpler (no Flash support, etc.).

Out of this trend arose a powerful new idea: progressive enhancement. In this version of the tale, you put your best foot forward on the mobile platform, providing the users with minimal screen real estate, processing power and third party plugins an amazing experience that both looks great and functions perfectly. As the need arises, the site can gradually be ""enhanced"" and even completely rethought for larger platforms with fewer constraints.

Why Progressive Enhancement Wins

At a glance, these two methodologies seem roughly equivalent. Who cares where you begin the design process as long as it gets done, right?

The reality of the situation is a little more complex though. When you start with the desktop platform, you tend want to take advantage of everything that platform has to offer. You build an amazing product that leverages lots of great technology, only to realize that none of it scales well down to mobile. This can and does lead to severely watered down mobile products that feel more like an afterthought than a polished, finished",0
"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway rejected on Friday a U.S. request to help destroy Syria's chemical arms, arguing that the Nordic nation was an unsuitable site because it lacked suitable staff, equipment and regulations.

Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide (L) and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Norwegian Parliament Ine Marie Eriksen Soreide prepare to speak to the media in Oslo, August 28, 2013. REUTERS/Cornelius Poppe/NTB Scanpix

Washington asked NATO-member Norway last month to help destroy some of Syria's chemical arsenal in a deal brokered with Moscow after an August 21 attack in the suburbs of Damascus killed 1,400 people. Several other nations are also being asked.

The Norwegian foreign ministry said the country had given ""serious and thorough consideration"" to the U.S. request but it was not best suited ""due to time constraints and external factors, such as capacities, regulatory requirements"".

""The two nations have come to the joint understanding that Norway is not the most suitable location for this destruction,"" a statement said.

On Wednesday, new Foreign Minister Boerge Brende told a news conference that Norway lacked equipment and that Norwegian law would ban storage of the waste.

That meant other countries would first have to guarantee to import and store the destroyed chemicals after they were treated in Norway, he said. Norway could use a U.S. mobile destruction unit but winter cold could be a disadvantage, he said.",0

"Fatal Car Accident Claims Lives of Three Teenagers

In a tragic turn of events, three teenagers lost their lives in a car accident on Tuesday night. The accident occurred at around 10 PM on the corner of Main Street and Elm Street, in the downtown area of the city. According to eyewitnesses, the vehicle, a recent model sedan, was traveling at high speed when it collided with a tree, sending debris flying and causing a loud explosion.

The police and paramedics were immediately called to the scene. Upon arrival, the paramedics pronounced the three teenagers, who were all in the vehicle, dead. The police have identified the victims as 18-year-old John Doe, 19-year-old Jane Doe, and 18-year-old Jack Doe.

The authorities have not yet released any information on the cause of the accident. However, some eyewitnesses have reported that the driver of the car was seen driving erratically just before the accident. The police are currently investigating the incident, and have asked anyone who may have witnessed the accident or have any information to come forward.

The news of the accident has shocked the community, with many expressing their condolences to the families of the victims. A makeshift memorial has been set up at the site of the accident, with flowers and candles placed in remembrance of the three teenagers.

As the investigation into the accident continues, the incident serves as a tragic reminder of the dangers of reckless driving. The police have urged all drivers to exercise caution and obey traffic laws in order to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.",1

Truck overturns on highway, causing traffic delays and spillage

A semi-trailer truck carrying a load of industrial chemicals overturned on the southbound lanes of State Route 6 yesterday afternoon, causing a hazardous materials spill and closing the road for several hours. The accident occurred around 3 p.m. near the exit to Westchester Avenue, when the driver of the truck lost control of the vehicle and hit the median barrier. The impact caused the truck to tilt onto its side, spilling some of its contents onto the roadway and blocking all lanes of traffic.

According to the first responders who arrived at the scene, the driver of the truck, who was the only occupant, suffered minor injuries and was transported to the nearby hospital for treatment. The cause of the accident is still under investigation, but initial reports suggest that the driver may have been speeding or distracted. The trucking company, which owns the truck and employs the driver, declined to comment on the incident.

As a result of the spill, the local authorities issued a shelter-in-place order for the residents living within a half-mile radius of the accident site, advising them to stay indoors and close their windows and doors until the hazardous materials team could contain the spill and assess the risks. The team, composed of firefighters, police officers, and hazardous materials specialists, worked for several hours to neutralize the chemicals and transfer them to a specialized container. Some of the chemicals, which were identified as flammable or corrosive, posed a danger to the environment and the public if not handled properly.

Meanwhile, the traffic on State Route 6 was diverted to the nearby streets, causing significant congestion and delays for the commuters and the businesses located in the area. The southbound lanes of the highway were reopened around 10 p.m., after the cleanup and the inspection of the roadway by the Department of Transportation. However, the northbound lanes remained closed until this morning, as the authorities continued to investigate the cause of the accident and assess the damage to the median barrier and the road surface.

The accident highlights the risks and consequences of transporting hazardous materials on the highways, as well as the importance of following safety regulations and maintaining proper training and equipment for the drivers and the carriers. The incident also underscores the need for emergency preparedness and response plans for the communities and the agencies that may be affected by such events.",1
"The War in Ukraine: A Struggle for Sovereignty

For the past seven years, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has captured the world's attention. What began as a series of protests in 2014 against then-president Viktor Yanukovych's pro-Russian policies, quickly escalated into a full-blown war between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

The conflict has claimed over 13,000 lives and displaced more than 1.5 million people. The war has also had a devastating impact on Ukraine's economy and infrastructure, with many towns and cities in the eastern regions left in ruins.

The reasons behind the conflict are complex and multifaceted. On one hand, Ukraine's desire for closer ties with the West and its decision to pivot away from Russia towards the European Union and NATO has been a major source of tension. On the other hand, Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for separatist rebels in the Donbass region have further fueled the conflict.

Efforts to resolve the conflict have been ongoing, but progress has been slow. The Minsk agreements, signed in 2015 and 2016, aimed to put an end to the fighting and establish a ceasefire, but violations of the agreements have been frequent, with both sides blaming each other for the continued violence.

The conflict has also had wider geopolitical implications. It has strained relations between Russia and the West, with the United States and European Union imposing economic sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine. It has also highlighted the ongoing struggle between Russia and the West for influence in the former Soviet republics.

While the situation in Ukraine remains tense, there have been some positive developments. In July 2020, a ceasefire was agreed upon, and progress has been made towards a prisoner exchange and the withdrawal of troops from certain areas. However, the situation remains fragile, and any small incident could spark a return to full-blown fighting.

The war in Ukraine serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting a country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It also highlights the dangers of geopolitical competition and the need for greater dialogue and cooperation between nations to prevent such conflicts from escalating in the future.",1
"Huge news on the coal export front just now. As Scott Learn at The Oregonian reports, ""Kinder Morgan drops plan to build coal export terminal at Port of St. Helens industrial park.""

Kinder Morgan had been planning to export as much as 30 million tons of coal each year on the Columbia River from a site near Clatskanie, Oregon, but their plans ran into a buzz saw of opposition from local communities, environmental and health advocates, and even nearby industrial users. This morning they announced that they are officially abandoning their plans to build a coal terminal at Port Westward.

Sightline's research was instrumental in the debate. We published extensive documentation of Kinder Morgan's problems with coal dust at their terminals, as well as the company's lengthy rap sheet of fraud, illegal dumping, and lax safety. A month after we published our research, the utility PGE announced that it would not sublease its land at Port Westward to Kinder Morgan out of concern that the spread of coal dust would damage its gas turbines. Since then, the firm has struggled to configure its plans, but local opposition continued to mount while prices in Asia weakened.

Today's news amounts to a huge victory for the Power Past Coal campaign. Of the six coal export terminals originally planned for the Northwest, three have now been withdrawn, in large part owing to an enormous backlash to the plans.

Predictably, Kinder Morgan is trying to downplay the role of coal export opponents in thwarting the company's plans:

Kinder Morgan's Allen Fore attributed the decision not to seek permits for a coal export terminal to site logistics at the Port of St. Helens industrial park, not the controversy over coal. ""We looked at multiple options and different footprints, but we couldn't find one compatible with the facility we wanted to construct,"" Fore said.

Yet the firm's statement is revealing. Kinder Morgan had a specific project design that they presented to the public. After PGE rejected the plan—out of very justifiable objection to Kinder Morgan's inability to contain coal dust—it had to go back to the drawing board. Having lost the element of surprise, they were met with opposition at every turn.

Find this article interesting? Please consider making a gift to support our work.

Kinder Morgan says, cryptically, that they are, ""still looking for coal export sites in the Northwest,"" though they won't name specific sites.

Postscript 5/14/13: A reader points out that this is actually Kinder Morgan's second failed coal terminal project this year. The company backed out of plans at the Port of Wilmington, Delaware after they failed to reach agreement with the local longshoreman's union.",0
"Local Man Seriously Injured in Car Accident

A local man was seriously injured in a car accident that occurred on Highway 101 yesterday afternoon. The man, whose name has not been released, was driving north on the highway when his car collided with a southbound vehicle.

According to witnesses, the northbound car appeared to swerve suddenly into the southbound lane, colliding head-on with the other vehicle. The force of the impact caused both cars to spin out of control and slide off the road.

Emergency responders arrived on the scene within minutes and found the driver of the northbound car trapped in his vehicle with serious injuries. They worked quickly to extricate him from the wreckage and transport him to the nearest hospital.

The condition of the other driver is unknown at this time, but sources indicate that he was conscious and able to speak with emergency responders at the scene.

The cause of the accident is still under investigation, and officials have not yet determined whether speed, alcohol, or other factors played a role in the crash.

The accident caused significant traffic delays on Highway 101, with both lanes closed for several hours as emergency responders worked to clear the scene and investigate the cause of the crash.

Local residents are reminded to exercise caution when driving on the highway and to always obey traffic laws to prevent accidents like this from happening. Our thoughts are with the injured driver and his family, and we hope for his speedy recovery.",1

"Special Event President Clinton Announces Largest Budget Surplus in the History of the Federal Government Aired September 27, 2000 - 9:57 a.m. ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. DARYN KAGAN, CNN ANCHOR: As promised, we go live to Washington, D.C. and the White House. Here is President Clinton. (JOINED IN PROGRESS) WILLIAM J. CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: ... and the poverty rate has fallen to its lowest level in 20 years. Today there's more good economic news. Eight years ago, our future was at risk. Economic growth was low, unemployment was high, interest rates were high, the federal debt had quadrupled in the previous 12 years. When Vice President Gore and I took office, the budget deficit was $290 billion, and it was projected this year the budget deficit would be $455 billion. The American people, thankfully, chose a better future. They put their support behind a new economic direction of fiscal discipline, greater investment in our people, expanded trade in our products. It's given us the longest economic expansion in history and the strongest fiscal turnaround in memory. Record budget deficits have given way to record surpluses. And this has enabled us to do something that would have been impossible just eight years ago -- we've actually begun to pay down the debt. Today we received more good news that our strategy is working. According to the Office of Management and Budget, this year's budget surplus will be at least $230 billion. With this surplus, we've been able to cut the debt over the last three years by this figure -- (writes the number on a chart) -- $360 billion in debt reduction over the last three years. This year alone we've cut the debt by at least $223 billion, the largest one-year debt reduction in the history of the United States. Like our Olympic athletes in Sydney, the American people are breaking all kinds of records these days. This is the first year we've balanced the budget without using the Medicare trust fund since Medicare was created in 1965. I think we should follow Al Gore's advice and lock those trust funds away for the future. We've come a long way since then, and a long way since 1993. But we can go further still. If we stay on the path we're on, we can pay this debt off entirely by 2012, for the first time since Andrew Jackson was President, in 1835. Paying off the debt will benefit America, just as paying off credit cards benefits the average family. It frees up money for the things that matter, and it keeps interest rates lower. That will mean more investment, more jobs, lower mortgage payments, car payments, and student loan payments. This is all terribly important. Already the benefits of debt reduction have meant about $2,000 a year -- or deficit reduction, and then debt reduction -- has been about $2,000 a year in lower interest payments for home mortgages, about $200 a year in lower interest payments for cars, about $200 a year for lower interest payments on college loans. And if we stay on this path, rather than go back and spend all the surplus and get back into the Social Security funds, it will keep interest rates about a point lower over the next decade. That will be worth in home mortgages alone over $300 billion. So this is a very important thing to do. And I hope that we will see a continuation of this trend in this year's final end-game budget negotiations. However, the fiscal year is almost over and Congress still has sent me only two of the 13 spending bills. We need to put our priorities in order and put the broad national interest above special interest. The key to fiscal discipline, to these kinds of results, is maintaining it each year, year after year. If you look at what's happened in the last eight years, federal spending today as a percentage of the economy is the lowest it has been since 1966. The federal civilian work force is the smallest it's been since 1960, down 377,000 from the day I took office. I am concerned, frankly, about the size and last-minute nature of this year's congressional spending spree, where they seem to be loading up the spending bills with special projects for special interests, but can't seem to find the time to raise the minimum wage, or pass a patients' bill of rights, or drug benefits for our seniors through Medicare, or tax cuts for long-term care, child care, or college education. And first and foremost, they haven't found the funds for education, for continuing to hire 100,000 qualified teachers to reduce class size, to build and modernize schools, to provide after-school for children who need it, and have real accountability for failing schools, requiring them to turn around or shut down or be put under new management. These are the things that",0
"Generative AI: Revolutionizing the Way We Create and Innovate

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been transforming numerous industries for a while now, from healthcare to finance. However, generative AI is a relatively new and exciting development that could change the way we create and innovate.

Generative AI is a subset of AI that involves using machine learning algorithms to generate content such as images, music, and even text. It essentially allows machines to learn and replicate patterns and styles similar to those created by humans.

One of the most significant benefits of generative AI is its ability to save time and resources. Before the advent of this technology, creating high-quality content required a lot of human effort, time, and money. With generative AI, machines can generate content with minimal human involvement, which is not only quick but also cost-effective.

Another advantage of generative AI is its potential to enhance creativity. By studying and replicating human patterns and styles, generative AI can create content that is not only high in quality but also unique and diverse.

The applications of generative AI are limitless. In the field of music, generative AI can create original compositions based on specific themes and genres, which can then be used in films, games, and other media. In fashion, generative AI can design unique clothing patterns and styles, reducing the time and effort required in the design process.

However, as with any new technology, generative AI also has its challenges. There is a risk that this technology could be used to create fake content, which could be used to manipulate public opinion or deceive people. There is also the issue of ownership and copyright, as the content generated by generative AI may not always be original.

Despite these challenges, the potential of generative AI cannot be ignored. As this technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see more innovative and creative solutions that could transform the way we create and innovate.

In conclusion, generative AI is a game-changer in the world of AI. Its potential to save time, enhance creativity, and generate original content is unparalleled. As we look forward to the future of generative AI, it is important to address the challenges that come with it and harness its full potential for the betterment of society.",1
"Dialysis High Costs and Hidden Perils of a Treatment Guaranteed to All

Dec. 10: This post has been updated twice.


Patients treated at dialysis clinics run by the largest U.S. for-profit chains have a higher risk of death than patients treated by the biggest nonprofit chain, a study released today in the journal Health Services Research concludes.

The outcome gaps are substantial: Patients at the largest for-profit chain were found to have a 19 percent higher risk of death than patients receiving care at the nonprofit; at the second-largest chain, the risk was 24 percent higher.

""The difference is very significant,"" said Yi Zhang, who led the study conducted by the Medical Technology & Practice Patterns Institute, a Bethesda nonprofit. ""It's not five or seven percent. It's pretty dramatic.""

The study also found that patients had a 13 percent lower mortality risk if they were treated at nonprofit clinics, regardless of chain ownership, than if they received care at for-profit clinics.

The study's findings are likely to stir debate because U.S. mortality rates for dialysis remain among the highest in the industrialized world -- one in five patients dies each year -- and because more patients than ever are getting their care from for-profit chains.

More than 80 percent of American dialysis clinics are run for profit. Chain ownership has increased more than 11-fold since the early 1990s. Two for-profit companies -- Fresenius Medical Care North America and DaVita Inc. -- now control about two-thirds of the market for dialysis care.

In a recent ProPublica investigation, some doctors, patients and advocates voiced concern that industry consolidation has winnowed down care options, thus reducing competition, and questioned whether providers' efforts to make money had affected quality.

Today's study does not identify chains by name, but Fresenius and DaVita ranked first and second in number of clinics in 2004, the start of the study period. Since then, they have acquired the two chains that were next in size. The largest nonprofit chain is Nashville-based Dialysis Clinic Inc.

A Fresenius spokeswoman said the company would not comment on the study's findings until it had a chance to examine them fully. DaVita officials said the study reflected an outdated version of reality.

""This study examines seven-year-old data, and significant changes in the way dialysis care is delivered have been made in the more than half a decade since, with continued overall improvement in patient outcomes,"" the company said in a written statement.

More recent information from the federally funded U.S. Renal Data System (USDRS) shows that large dialysis providers achieve better mortality outcomes than nonchain or hospital-based facilities, the DaVita statement added.

The MTPPI study excluded patients treated in hospital centers -- a key difference with some previous studies -- because they tend to treat patients with more complicating conditions, government data show.

In comparing chains to each other, however, the study's results largely mirror those in reports by the USRDS showing that Dialysis Clinic Inc. has lower mortality and hospitalization rates than other large dialysis providers.

The study tracked about 34,900 Medicare patients who started dialysis in 2004 at 3,601 free-standing clinics, following them for two years. Medicare pays for most dialysis under an entitlement created in 1972.

Researchers compared outcomes at the five largest dialysis chains -- four for-profits and one nonprofit -- and at nonchain clinics. They adjusted data for differences in patient mix, as well as for facility size, staffing, geographic disparities and income inequality.

In addition to lower mortality risk, the study found that patients at the nonprofit chain had the shortest hospital stays and were most likely to be in the recommended range for anemia, despite being given the lowest doses of anemia-treatment drugs. Its clinics also were staffed differently, with more nurses relative to patient-care technicians, who are unlicensed and, typically, lower paid.

Update (12/9): DCI did not comment on specific findings but released a statement from founder and board Chairman Dr. H. Keith Johnson saying the chain's ""non-profit status allows us to devote a larger proportion of our resources to improving the care we offer to our patients.""

Update (12/10): Fresenius spokeswoman Jane A. Kramer today issued the following statement:

""From the study's title, the methods-- all the way to the concluding statements, the authors loosely used the terms chain-affiliation, profit status, and chain size, three separate dimensions, and disingenuously intermingled them to reveal a strong pre-analytic bias. The authors themselves state that selection bias is 'likely to exist.' These data are over 5-7 years old – the environment has changed, with new scientific discoveries and clinical practice changes in place. It's difficult to imagine",0
"FLINT, MI -- The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is sending two liaisons to Michigan to aid in Flint's water crisis.

FEMA Director of Public Affairs Rafael Lemaitre sent out a tweet Friday, Jan. 8 that the stated the agency is ""closely following the #FlintWater situation."" Lemaitre sent out another tweet a short on his Twitter account that read:

"""I wish I was a child again, so I don't need to worry about paying bills.""

Such is the phrase of many people going through that point in life known in media as ""adulting""- or being responsible enough to actually care about where your money goes.

Whether we like it or not, money is inseparably connected to our life. In financial perspectives, money should not be the root of all evil. Money is what you make to have the finer things in life, not necessarily to make you rich—but something you need to have security so you and your family can have a comfortable life, plus some extra perks.

Going through different milestones in life also calls for different aspirations. What you dream as a child is not the same when you reach college. What you may have aspired in your twenties has now changed in your forties.

Many of us were not really educated in school when it comes to handling money. Majority of graduates who go into the workforce barely have any idea regarding the habits they should develop the moment they receive their first paycheck. Only a few are actually aware of how important it is to set their financial goals. You've come to the right page if you want to equip yourself with basic knowledge about the right attitudes toward your finances according to your life stage.

Let's get started.

Stage 1: Entering the Workforce – Early Career Years

If you are still on this stage and you are reading this blog post, congratulations! You should know that the first step toward better financial literacy when you are in your early career years is making a budget and tracking your expenses. If you are still paying your students loans, prioritize paying off your debt. Remember that you need to build a good credit history while in this stage of life. When you have a favorable financial standing according to bank standards, it becomes easier to purchase an asset such as a car or a dream home on credit once you plan on settling down maybe five to ten years from now.

You should also start planning your retirement and take advantage of 401(k), 403(b), Roth IRA and the likes that your employer might be offering. Also, even when you're still in your 20's and single, a disability insurance policy is crucial. This is to protect your income in case of a sudden event that prohibits you from working and earning. If you get seriously sick for example, the disability insurance can cover your expenses while recuperating and you don't have to incur debt because of medical expenses.

In summary, these are the things you must accomplish during your early career years:

Build your savings and establish a good credit history. Avoid increasing your consumer and high interest rate debts any further and pay the outstanding ones as soon as possible. Live within your means. Start thinking about your retirement and set up your financial accounts. Get disability insurance.

You may also welcome the idea of scouting for a reliable financial planner. As you advance in your career and possibly consider starting your own family at the later part of this stage in your life, a fee-based expert in wealth management with an eye on your goals can help you out in ensuring that you are on the right track in terms of your finances.

Stage 2: Family and Career Building Years

Are you about to settle down or have already built a family? Settling down is more than just getting married and having your dream house. It comes with greater responsibilities and of course greater expectations. It is not a matter of your personal dreams anymore because your aspirations have to match your spouse's, especially when it comes to building a home– a.k.a. having kids.

Of course, what first goes to mind is buying a house. Buying such an asset is important, especially if the family is growing. However, buying a house also means securing your budget for maintenance, amortization, utilities, and other expenses. Therefore, protecting your income becomes all the more important than when you were single. This is to keep your family protected in the event of some of life's risks, such as an untimely death and temporary or permanent disability.

In this life stage, your goals should include:

Buying life insurance. Purchasing health insurance. Updating your disability insurance. Reviewing your estate plan and preparing your will. Saving for your child's college education. Starting your own business or building your career further. Growing your savings.

While saving will always be an important goal for every life stage, spending on things that can protect your family from risks is always a good investment.

Setting up your estate plan and preparing your will are also vital as you increase your assets and produce more beneficiaries. They are vital for a very simple reason: you love your family.

As for preparing for your child's college education, there are variable unit-linked life insurance policies where the plan is designed to grow your premiums in favor of educational and retirement planning. Explore your options.

"Title: Records Smashed and New Stars Emerged in the World of Sports

The world of sports never disappoints when it comes to surprises and unexpected victories. This past week was no exception as world records were shattered, young up-and-coming stars emerged, and veteran athletes made stunning comebacks.

In the world of track and field, Usain Bolt's 100-meter record of 9.58 seconds was shattered by the American sprinter Trayvon Bromell, who clocked in at 9.55 seconds, breaking the record by a hair. Fans were left stunned as the 25-year-old made history at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo.

Meanwhile, in the tennis world, 18-year-old Emma Raducanu stole the spotlight at the US Open. The British youngster became the first qualifier in history to win a Grand Slam tournament, defeating Canadian Leylah Fernandez in a thrilling final match. Raducanu's remarkable run saw her win ten matches in a row, without dropping a single set. She is now set to become a household name in the world of tennis.

In the NFL, Tom Brady showed that he is still the king of football after leading the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a stunning 31-29 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. The 44-year-old quarterback threw for 379 yards and four touchdowns, cementing his place as one of the greatest players in NFL history.

In the world of basketball, the USA men's team secured their fourth consecutive gold medal",1
"Yes, a lot of the issues with the keyboard remain. It's narrow, tightly spaced and otherwise not the best keyboard BlackBerry has ever made. (To me, that honor goes to the Bold 9900.) Also, a slider design on a large 5.4-inch phone creates a unique problem: It's so tall in its extended mode that I occasionally had to hold it close to me to avoid banging against nearby objects. For that matter, the software autocorrect would sometimes fail to kick in while I was using the physical keyboard, leaving me to correct typos like it was 2006 all over again.

But when everything works, it works. It's not so much the speed -- it's not that much faster than using a touchscreen keyboard -- as the feel and how it frees up screen space. There's something satisfying about flicking out the keyboard to wake the phone and dash off a message. And hiding the software keyboard is just perfect for chat apps like Hangouts, where all that newly freed-up real estate lets me track more of the conversation without scrolling. Although the on-screen keyboard is well-done, I found myself leaning toward the old-school buttons when I had the chance.

Part of the appeal comes when I do have to scroll, mind you. The keyboard's gesture support is inconsistent, even within apps (Flickr reverses scrolling directions in different sections, for instance), but on the whole it's very useful. I can read an article without obscuring the page, or follow the strands of a long Twitter conversation without lifting my hands off the keys. While I didn't use the other features much (such as selecting text or erasing whole words), they were nice to have now and then. These gestures were also present on the Passport, of course, but it's still great to have them here too, especially when there's a rich app ecosystem that can take advantage of those keyboard swipes.

How does the rest of the Priv stack up, you ask? Pretty well, actually. The quad HD display and 18-megapixel camera remain good but not great, and the battery life with heavy use (e.g., social networking and music streaming) is merely average despite the big 3,410mAh battery. However, the phone could almost always keep up with what I wanted to do. The Snapdragon 808 chip and 3GB of RAM aren't as powerful as you'll get in some phones in this class, but they're still up to the job of driving a flagship device. About the only let-down was the low-light photography, which was reasonably bright but also noisy and colorless (though it did get better, as you'll see below). You could never touch the Priv's keyboard and still get a pretty solid smartphone.

And yes, moving to Android has done wonders for the BlackBerry experience. As good as a few elements of BlackBerry 10 were -- multitasking in particular -- it's refreshing to have an ample supply of native apps, instead of repackaged titles or, more often, nothing at all. Instagram? Flickr? Swarm? Yes to all of them. BlackBerry's custom touches are generally welcome, too, like pop-up widgets and stars to indicate apps with notifications. Some of the software is superfluous outside of certain business users; I didn't really need DTEK's security audits, for instance. All the same, I'd say BlackBerry struck a fine balance between maintaining Android's strong points and catering to faithful users.

I'd add that BlackBerry has been good about supporting the Priv in the time I've used it. A major December update improved performance across the board, including the camera's low-light quality. On top of that, there have been numerous app updates to tweak the functionality and fix bugs. It's still not flawless: One recent crash forced me to reboot the phone. However, this is the kind of tremendous post-launch support that I wish other phone manufacturers would offer. That extra level of care stems partly from make-or-break necessity (BlackBerry may quit hardware entirely if sales remain poor), but it's greatly appreciated.

My main concern is that the Priv isn't quite as transformative an experience as BlackBerry arguably needs it to be. I did get hooked on typing on that hardware keyboard, but I felt back at home the moment I went back to typing on glass with other phones. The physical keys weren't so addictive that I found myself missing them dearly, and that's a problem when rivals like the Galaxy Note 5 and Nexus 6P are faster, take better photos and otherwise sport more bells and whistles. Even so, I'm going to miss the Priv -- and that's something I haven't said about a BlackBerry in a long time.",0
"Mathematics: Unlocking the Secrets of the Universe

Mathematics has long been regarded as one of the most important and fascinating subjects in the world. From simple arithmetic to complex calculus, it plays a crucial role in everyday life and has revolutionized the way we understand the world around us.

At its core, mathematics is the study of numbers, patterns, and shapes. It is a discipline that seeks to understand and explain the relationships between these elements, and to use them to solve real-world problems.

One of the most exciting areas of mathematics is its application in physics. In recent years, mathematicians have been working closely with physicists to develop new models and theories about the nature of the universe. For example, the use of calculus has enabled physicists to accurately describe the behavior of subatomic particles, and has led to the discovery of new particles and forces.

Another area where mathematics is making significant contributions is in the field of data science. With the explosion of data in recent years, mathematicians and computer scientists are working together to develop sophisticated algorithms and models to make sense of all this information. This has led to breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, where algorithms are now able to recognize patterns and make predictions with incredible accuracy.

But the impact of mathematics is not just limited to the sciences. It has also revolutionized fields such as finance, engineering, and even music. In finance, mathematics is used to develop complex models that help traders and investors make decisions about where to invest their money. In engineering, it is used to design everything from skyscrapers to bridges, ensuring that these structures are safe and stable. And in music, mathematics is used to create new compositions and analyze existing ones, helping us to understand why certain pieces of music are so powerful and emotionally resonant.

Despite its many achievements, mathematics remains a challenging and often intimidating subject for many people. But with the increasing recognition of its importance in so many fields, more and more people are beginning to appreciate its beauty and power.",1

FATAL CRASH ON HIGHWAY 101

Three people died and two were injured in a head-on collision on Highway 101 near Los Angeles yesterday afternoon. The accident occurred around 4:30 p.m. on a stretch of the freeway known for its sharp curves and heavy traffic, according to the California Highway Patrol.

The victims were identified as 23-year-old Maria Garcia, 45-year-old David Lee, and 60-year-old Sandra Kim, all residents of nearby towns. Garcia was driving a Honda Civic southbound when she allegedly crossed the center line and collided with Lee's Toyota Camry heading northbound. Kim, who was a passenger in the Camry, died at the scene, while Garcia and Lee were taken to a local hospital, where they later succumbed to their injuries.

The two other passengers in the Camry, a 10-year-old boy and a 78-year-old woman, were also injured and transported to the hospital. Their conditions were not immediately available, but they were said to be stable. The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but authorities said that speed and driver error may have been factors.

The accident caused a major traffic jam on the busy highway, as several lanes were closed for several hours while the wreckage was cleared and the investigation was conducted. Many drivers were stuck in their cars for hours, some of them trying to get to the airport or other destinations. Some witnesses described the scene as chaotic and heartbreaking, with debris and cars scattered across the road, and emergency responders rushing to help the victims.

The CHP urged drivers to be cautious and attentive while driving, especially on roads with challenging terrain or heavy traffic. They also reminded motorists to always wear their seat belts and avoid distractions such as texting or talking on the phone while driving. The agency expressed condolences to the families and friends of the victims and hoped for a speedy recovery of the injured.

The accident was the latest in a series of deadly crashes on California highways this year, which have claimed dozens of lives and raised concerns about the state's transportation infrastructure and safety policies. Experts say that improving road design, maintenance, and enforcement could help prevent many accidents, as well as educating drivers about the risks and consequences of reckless or impaired driving.",1

"WASHINGTON—Dredging up a past that Newt Gingrich has worked hard to bury, the GOP presidential candidate's second ex-wife says Gingrich asked for an ""open marriage"" in which he could have both a wife and a mistress.

In an interview with ABC News' ""Nightline"" scheduled to air Thursday night, Marianne Gingrich said she refused to go along with the idea that she share her husband with Callista Bisek, who would later become his third wife.

The explosive interview was airing just two days before the presidential primary in South Carolina, a state with a strong Christian conservative bent, and as Gingrich tries to present himself as the strongest alternative to front-runner Mitt Romney.

In excerpts of the interview released ahead the ABC broadcast, Marianne Gingrich said her husband conducted his affair with Callista ""in my bedroom in our apartment in Washington"" while she was elsewhere.

""He always called me at night and always ended with `I love you,'"" she said. ""Well, she was listening.""

Marianne Gingrich, who was Gingrich's second wife, said Gingrich told her ""Callista doesn't care what I do.""

""He was asking to have an open marriage and I refused,"" she said. ""That is not a marriage.""

She also said Gingrich moved to divorce her just months after she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

""He also was advised by the doctor when I was sitting there that I was not to be under stress,"" she said. ""He knew.""

Gingrich, asked by a voter Thursday about his past mistakes, said questions about his past life were inevitable but that he'd long since sought forgiveness. He said he expected attacks when he got into the race.

""We knew we would get beaten up,"" he said while campaigning in Beaufort, S.C. ""We knew we'd get lied about. We knew we'd get smeared. We knew there would be nasty ads and we decided the country was worth the pain.""

Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond flatly rejected Marianne Gingrich's account, saying: ""It couldn't be any more opposite of the truth.""

He told reporters that he wouldn't say anything against his ex-wife, but added that his two daughters from his first marriage had written to ABC to complain that the interview was ""tawdry and inappropriate."" He didn't answer questions about the specifics of the interview, directing questions to his daughters.

In an interview Thursday with The Washington Post, Marianne Gingrich said that within days of asking for a divorce, her husband gave a speech in which he stressed the importance of ethics and family values in American culture.",0
"Local High School Wins State Championship in Football

The local high school football team has brought home the state championship trophy for the first time in over a decade. The team, led by head coach John Smith, finished the season with an impressive record of 10 wins and 2 losses.

The championship game, held at the state's largest stadium, was a nail-biter from start to finish. The local team faced off against their toughest rivals, who had won the state championship for the past three years in a row.

Despite being the underdogs, the local team showed determination and grit throughout the game. They took the lead early in the first quarter, and managed to hold onto it despite the intense pressure from their opponents.

The team's defense was particularly impressive, managing to hold off their opponents' offensive plays and preventing them from scoring any touchdowns for the majority of the game. The team's offensive line also put on a stellar performance, managing to break through the rival team's defense and score several touchdowns themselves.

The local team's fans were ecstatic as they watched their team lift the championship trophy at the end of the game. The players were hailed as heroes as they made their way back to the high school, where they were greeted by cheering fans and a banner congratulating them on their victory.

Coach Smith praised his team's hard work and dedication throughout the season. ""These young men have worked tirelessly to achieve this victory,"" he said. ""I couldn't be prouder of them.""",1
"OTTAWA — The Ontario government is disputing NDP Leader Tom Mulcair's assertion that the country's largest province supports his plan to create one million $15-a-day child-care spaces.

Ontario's education minister, Liz Sandals, says the province welcomes new investments and interest from ""all federal partners"" on child care.

But she said Mulcair has not provided sufficient details of his plan — which would require provinces to pick up 40 per cent of the tab — to determine whether Ontario would be prepared to buy in.

The NDP is proposing to create one million child-care spaces over eight years that would be accessible to parents for $15 a day, regardless of income. The federal government would pick up 60 per cent of the cost, which the NDP estimates would cost the federal treasury $5 billion annually once fully implemented.

The NDP says Manitoba, British Columbia and New Brunswick have signalled a willingness to negotiate a shared-cost child-care program.

However, Sandals said Ontario has already spent billions on child care and full-day kindergarten and those investments would have to be recognized ""in full"" in any national program requiring matching provincial funds.

If Ontario and other provinces were to insist that money already being spent on child care be counted as part of their matching share of a national program, that could significantly reduce the number of new spaces Mulcair is promising to create.

Ontario's view of the NDP child-care proposal was thrown into question Saturday after Liberal MP John McCallum predicted Mulcair's plan will never materialize because provinces don't have the money to contribute their share of the program, which he pegged at $3.3 billion.

""Where are the provinces going to come up with $3.3 billion? I come from Ontario. Ontario has a significant deficit. Ontario would have to come up with a billion dollars-plus per year,"" McCallum told a news conference.

""If the provinces don't come up with the money, there won't be any child-care spaces.""

Wynne, who has been actively campaigning for Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau in the federal campaign, signed onto a letter from all premiers to Prime Minister Stephen Harper just last month, in which the provincial leaders called for federal ""supports to families such as affordable, quality childcare.""

Moreover, Wynne's Liberals supported an NDP motion in the Ontario legislature last fall calling on the province to ""partner with the federal government to ensure every parent in Ontario has access to child care at a cost of no more than $15 a day per child.""

But Sandals said that motion included no specific details on how such a program would be funded.

She said Ontario has gone from spending $530 million annually on child care to more than $1 billion while creating 130,000 new daycare spaces. Moreover, she said 470,000 children are benefiting from the provincial government's introduction of full-day kindergarten, without which every one of those children would need child care.

""We expect that any funding for child care that requires provincial matching would recognize these commitments in full,"" Sandals said.

Asked whether Ontario might refuse to ante up any further funding on the basis that its existing investments already amount to its 40 per cent share of the NDP's proposed program, Sandals said: ""I cannot speak to specifics that haven't been shared in the NDP proposal.""

However, Mulcair might have no choice but to give Ontario, or any other province, its share of federal funding whether or not it puts up an additional dime of its own.

Under the NDP's 10-year-old policy on Quebec, known as the Sherbrooke declaration, the party has adopted the principle that provinces should be allowed to opt out of federal programs in areas of provincial jurisdiction — such as day care — with full compensation.",0

Poverty, Water, Animals: On Charity and the Why

A good friend and I were talking about money, charity and volunteering one day and he expressed an opinion that took me aback.

We're so often in agreement given our remarkably similar backgrounds, we put ourselves through school, supported our families from a young age, worked really hard for a long time to get where we are, that I struggled to understand why he was against volunteering and charity.

While I feel that I worked really hard to get here, I didn't get here without help; he feels that he worked really hard to get here and doesn't feel that he got any help so he doesn't feel he should give back to the community at large. Granted, we didn't travel the exact same path but it's hard for me to fathom overlooking the small kindnesses of strangers, like the support from a guidance counselor or a colleague who lobbied for your job security. These are the kinds of things that, though small, add up. They make a difference.

Pat Rothfuss, one of my favorite writers and a stand-up kind of guy, explained it far better than I managed that day:

The simple truth is, Jason, at this point in my life, I have enough money to live comfortably. And in my opinion, if you have enough money to live comfortably and you keep trying to get more and more and more money… well… it's kind of an asshole thing to do. It's like this: if you have one piece of cake, and you eat it, that's fine. If you have two pieces of cake, you should probably share some with a friend. But maybe not. Occasionally we could all use two pieces of cake. But if you have a whole cake, and you eat *all* of it, that's not very cool. It's not just selfish, it's kinda sick and unhealthy.

[…]

That's why I do all the charity work. Because the world isn't as good as I want it to be.

I don't have a better explanation than that for why I felt compelled to help those who have less. ""The world isn't as good as I want it to be"", so, let's do something about that.

I don't belong to the ""have too many cakes"" camp, particularly since I still support two adult dependents who aren't my children, but while I aim to become that kind of wealthy someday, I don't need to be that wealthy to want to make a difference. I can't save any one person but sometimes a helping hand is all you need, sometimes it gives you enough hope to scrape yourself off the floor and keep going.

And that's why I still give. Even though I'm all about personal responsibility and bootstrapping, I remember when a kind gesture was enough to help me do another job, fight another day.

PiC and I get an annual spending allowance out of our shared budget. This is purely for us to spend, however we want, that has nothing to do with necessities which are covered. It's not much, but it's not little either.

I usually hoard mine (SMAAUUGGGG) but this year, I'm making a conscious effort to give between 10-20% to meaningful charities.

Pat Rothfuss's Worldbuilders was one: This was a massive fundraising drive to donate to Heifer International. They do good work, without much waste, and helping people make their own livelihood resonates with me.

Nathan Fillion and his Clean Water campaign for his birthday is another. I love my Captain and I love clean water for people. I remember, growing up, hearing the stories of how the people in our villages had to carry their water, in buckets, up from the streams. Backbreaking work for survival.

Last, and most dear to my heart, the Humane Society & Rescue Organization where we adopted Doggle. Rescuing animals: FTW!

Also, as always, I'll be collecting things that are in good shape but we really don't need anymore and donating them to charity that can use them: homeless and battered women/children's shelters.

Which side of the fence do you stand on? What are your thoughts on the subject?

"Yes fish, no fish, red fish…OK fish?

Advertisement - Continue Reading Below

Our oceans have become so depleted of wild fish stocks, and so polluted with industrial contaminants, that trying to figure out the fish that are both safe and sustainable can make your head spin. ""Good fish"" lists can change year after year, because stocks rebound or get depleted every few years, but there are some fish that, no matter what, you can always decline.

The nonprofit Food & Water Watch looked at all the varieties of fish out there, how they were harvested, how certain species are farmed, and levels of toxic contaminants like mercury or PCBs in the fish, as well as how heavily local fishermen relied upon fisheries for their economic survival. These are the 12 fish, they determined, that all of us should avoid, no matter what.

See exactly what a sustainable fish is:

​

1. Imported catfish

Why it's bad: Nearly 90% of the catfish imported to the US comes from Vietnam, where use of antibiotics that are banned in the US is widespread. Furthermore, the two varieties of Vietnamese catfish sold in the US, Swai and Basa, aren't technically considered catfish by the federal government and therefore aren't held to the same inspection rules that other imported catfish are.

Eat this instead: Stick with domestic, farm-raised catfish, advises Marianne Cufone, director of the Fish Program at Food & Water Watch. It's responsibly farmed and plentiful, making it one of the best fish you can eat. Or, try Asian carp, an invasive species with a similar taste to catfish that's out-competing wild catfish and endangering the Great Lakes ecosystem.

2. Caviar

Why it's bad: Caviar from beluga and wild-caught sturgeon are susceptible to overfishing, according to the Food and Water Watch report, but the species are also being threatened by an increase in dam building that pollutes the water in which they live. All forms of caviar come from fish that take a long time to mature, which means that it takes a while for populations to rebound.

Eat this instead: If you really love caviar, opt for fish eggs from American Lake Sturgeon or American Hackleback/Shovelnose Sturgeon caviar from the Mississippi River system.

3. Atlantic cod

Advertisement - Continue Reading Below

Why it's bad: This one was difficult to add to the ""dirty dozen list,"" says Cufone, because it is so vital to the economic health of New England fishermen. ""However, chronic mismanagement by the National Marine Fisheries Service and low stock status made it very difficult to recommend,"" she says. Atlantic cod stocks collapsed in the mid-1990s and are in such disarray that the species is now listed as one step above endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species.

Eat this instead: The good news, if you love fish 'n' chips (which is nearly always made with cod), is that Pacific cod stocks are still strong and are one of Food and Water Watch's best fish picks.

4. American eel

Why it's bad: Also called yellow or silver eel, this fish, which frequently winds up in sushi dishes, made its way onto the list because it's highly contaminated with PCBs and mercury. The fisheries are also suffering from some pollution and overharvesting.

Eat this instead: If you like the taste of eel, opt for Atlantic- or Pacific-caught squid instead.

5. Imported shrimp

Advertisement - Continue Reading Below

Why it's bad: Imported shrimp actually holds the designation of being the dirtiest of the ""dirty dozen,"" says Cufone, and it's hard to avoid, as 90% of shrimp sold in the U.S. is imported. ""Imported farmed shrimp comes with a whole bevy of contaminants: antibiotics, residues from chemicals used to clean pens, filth like mouse hair, rat hair, and pieces of insects,"" Cufone says. ""And I didn't even mention things like E. coli that have been detected in imported shrimp."" Part of this has to do with the fact that less than 2% of ALL imported seafood (shrimp, crab, catfish, or others) gets inspected before its sold, which is why it's that much more important to buy domestic seafood. (Read more about The Not-So-Simple Life of Shrimp and how to make the best choices for your dinner table.)

Eat this instead: Look for domestic shrimp. Seventy percent of domestic shrimp comes from the Gulf of Mexico, which relies heavily on shrimp for economic",0

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (October 13, 2015) - A gas station clerk was shot over an order of nachos, police say. Officials and family members identified the victim as Kyle Frye, 24.

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) officers were dispatched to the Speedway gas station at 71st Street and Keystone Avenue around 1:15 a.m. on a report of a robbery. When they arrived on scene, they found Frye shot in the face and abdomen.

Witnesses say the suspect went into the gas station shortly after 1 a.m. and asked the clerk about nachos. The suspect exchanged a few words with the clerk before leaving. He then returned moments later, pulled out a gun and shot the clerk twice.

The suspect, Terrance Harris, 26, didn't want cash but he did take off with the nachos.

Police say Frye was able to walk to the front door and locked it until police arrived. Officers found the victim lying on the floor of the gas station.

EMS crews transported the victim to St. Vincent Hospital.

Surveillance cameras from the gas station captured clear images of Harris during the shooting. He was later taking into custody for questioning and then arrested. Harris faces preliminary charges of attempted murder and robbery.

At this point, investigators believe the shooting was random.

""In this case it's really hard to comprehend that someone walks right up to a clerk and raises their gun at someone and just shoots them,"" said IMPD officer Rafael Diaz.

Frye's family told FOX59 he had just transferred to the north side Speedway a couple months ago. He was working the late shift on his birthday.

""He is truly a good brother, friend, son, uncle and human being. I don't know why this senseless act of violence befell him. Thoughts and prayers are much appreciated and needed,"" a family member said.

As of Tuesday evening, Frye remains in critical condition.",0
"Brussels, Belgium- The European educational system has always been a topic of interest among scholars and researchers. The continuous efforts made by European countries in the field of education have earned them a reputation for having some of the world's best educational systems.

One such country is Finland, which has been consistently ranked as one of the top countries in education. The Finnish educational system is unique in its approach, which emphasizes equal opportunities for all students regardless of their socio-economic background.

In Finland, education is free for all, including higher education. The Finnish government invests heavily in education, allocating around 11% of its GDP to the sector. The education system is divided into primary, secondary and tertiary education, with students starting school at the age of 7.

The primary education system is designed to provide a strong foundation in education to students, with an emphasis on the development of basic skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. Students are not subjected to standardized testing in their early years, and teachers are given a high degree of autonomy in the classroom. This helps them to tailor their teaching to the individual needs of each student.

In secondary education, students are given more freedom to choose their subjects, with the aim of providing them with a more personalized education. The curriculum is designed to provide students with a broad range of skills and knowledge that will prepare them for their future careers.

In tertiary education, Finnish universities offer a high standard of education, with a strong focus on research and innovation. Finnish universities are consistently ranked among the top universities in the world, with the University of Helsinki being the highest-ranked Finnish university, according to the QS World University Rankings.

The Finnish education system's success can be attributed to several factors, including the high degree of investment in education, the emphasis on equal opportunities, and the focus on personalized education. The Finnish education system has become a model for other countries looking to reform their education systems.

In conclusion, the Finnish educational system is a prime example of how a country can invest in its citizens' education to provide them with equal opportunities and a better future. It is an excellent example for other countries to follow to achieve similar success in education.",1

""They had merely to sit on the edges of Tianfu Square wearing smog masks for police bring them in for interrogation until the early hours of the morning — this is a clear show of how deeply anxious Chengdu authorities are about protests against smog.""

For the last week, inland China has been enveloped in smog. Some cities issued emergency smog warnings; others cancelled outdoor activities at schools. In Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, the government banned gatherings in Tianfu Square (天府广场)— as though they were afraid of something. And just as expected, on the weekend, Chengdu residents came out in numbers on Chunxi road in the central business district and on Tianfu Square. Some sat down quietly wearing pollution masks, others held up banners of protest.

In the frigid winter night of a smog-enclosed 2016, the protest of Chengdu residents was like the flash of a shooting star.

These are the ""smog politics"" of contemporary China. The smog question has almost transformed the landscape of Chinese politics since February 2015, with the broadcast of the documentary ""Under the Dome"" (穹顶之下) by former CCTV journalist Chai Jing (柴静). The government has been busy: Under the aegis of unifying the Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei) conurbation, Beijing has embarked on a project of social engineering aimed at resolving the smog problem: heavily polluting industries in Hebei have been forced to lower output, stop production, or shutter; Beijing has embarked on a program of ""low-end population congestion relief;"" and villages on the outskirts of Beijing are in the midst of converting from coal-based to to natural gas energy for heating. Meanwhile, smog continues to enshroud China now and then, and saturating social media is the discontent of the Chinese middle-class, only interrupted from time to time by a variety of other politically-tinged incidents — the ""poisoned running tracks,"" ""the Lei Yang incident,"" the ""Luo Er fundraising scandal,"" and bullying at the Zhongguancun No. 2 Elementary School.

It is as though a new middle class, as full of uncertainty as it is of energy, is rapidly forming its own class politics in the shroud of China's smog. There is, for instance, the movement to ""make a fortune and get out as soon as possible,"" referring to emigration. There are also large collectives of underground discontent who express themselves on social media. And then there are always the unexpected small-scale protest actions in the streets.

Even as the authorities move to suppress human rights lawyers and emphasize once again political thought work in schools, a politically-awakened middle-class, oriented around the politics of pollution, is forming in a rapidly urbanizing China. With their own series of often indecisive demands and modes of expression, they've begun to displace the rights defense movement that came before, and their numbers are quietly growing.

For instance, on the evening of December 11 in Tianfu Square, the majority of those in the sit-in were local artists and culture workers — they'd either come of their own initiative, or were mobilized by emphatic protest slogans shared on social media in the last few days. The online posts advertising the protest seemed to be inspired by the confluence of art and politics over the last few years: the various artistic creations of Ai Weiwei (艾未未), for instance, or the protest performances of the Song Zhuang art circle (北京宋庄艺术圈子), or the anti-smog demonstrations during the Beijing Marathon. They had merely to sit on the edges of Tianfu Square wearing smog masks for police to bring them in for interrogation until the early hours of the morning — this is a clear show of how deeply anxious Chengdu authorities are about protests against smog. Local social media users on Monday even circulated an official notice that the wearing of masks is prohibited during school assembly, and that air purifiers were not going to be installed. It's as though wearing a face mask is mobilizing for a color revolution.

The deep fearfulness of the regime makes clear the power of middle-class politics ""under the dome"": they need barely to raise a crowd — simply holding a small-scale protest action, even when unlikely to have any real effect, makes the authorities extremely nervous, and they rally the troops like it was the eve of battle. The Pengzhou petrochemical project (彭州石化项目), close to Chengdu and most likely to have a deleterious impact on the environment, probably won't be scrapped because of this.

According to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' official website, kicker Connor Barth will miss the entire season due to a torn Achilles' tendon. Barth suffered the injury while playing in a charity basketball game.

As polarizing a position as it may be, losing their franchise kicker is a damaging blow to Tampa Bay's postseason odds.

The Buccaneers displayed Barth's value last year, signing him to a four-year contract worth $13.2 million. Barth responded by converting 84.8 percent of his field goals and becoming the most accurate kicker in franchise history.

Per Andrew Brandt of ESPN, Tampa Bay hasn't decided what to do with Barth's salary.

With a devastating injury to the part of his body that matters most to his career, it's unclear what this means for Barth's future in Tampa Bay.

What is clear, however, is the Bucs have dreams of reaching the postseason and becoming a contender. They acquired Darrelle Revis, have a star at running back with Doug Martin and work under a head coach, Greg Schiano, with undeniable potential.

Losing a veteran like Barth doesn't offset those strengths, nor does it eliminate Tampa Bay from the postseason—it simply makes their road a little more difficult.

Power, Accuracy and Consistency

During the 2012 NFL regular season, Barth converted 28-of-33 field goal attempts for the Buccaneers. He also made a perfect 39-of-39 extra-point attempts and hit 90.0 percent of his field goals during the fourth quarter.

Most importantly, Barth was able to land kicks from all over the field.

18 of Barth's 28 field goals made were from at least 40 yards away, tying for the league lead in that regard. Six of those field goals were from 50-plus yards, which placed fourth among all kickers.

That type of power and accuracy doesn't grow on trees.

Kickers may be viewed as less-than-prolific players on NFL teams, but Barth gave Tampa Bay confidence that they could walk away with points if they crossed an opponent's 40-yard line. As a part of his 40-plus yard mastery, he converted two field goals from at least 55 yards away, including a 57-yard blast.

If that's not enough, four of his five misses came during a four-week span—during the other 12 weeks, he was 24-of-25.

Lawrence Tynes' Range

Lawrence Tynes is popularly known as one of the heroes from the New York Giants' past two Super Bowl titles. As the Giants' fanbase will unbiasedly tell you, however, Tynes is a streaky kicker who struggles to convert deep attempts.

It's also worth noting that Barth made more kicks from 50-plus yards and out in 2012 than Tynes has in his past four regular seasons combined.

To replace one of the best long-ball kickers in professional football, the Bucs have landed a player with limited range. Tynes certainly has the postseason pedigree, but in terms of contributing when it matters for 16 consecutive games, there's reason to doubt his ability.

Something that wouldn't have been the case with Barth.

Barth has a more powerful leg than Tynes and, as he's progressed as a player, has become more consistent. There's no question which player we'd rather have in the Super Bowl, but right now, Tampa Bay is a young team looking to grow as a unit.

Losing an important member of their roster is a major setback that could expose their youth on offense.

Offensive Inconsistencies

Doug Martin was a Rookie of the Year candidate and Pro Bowl selection during the 2012 regular season. He picked up 1454 yards and 11 touchdowns, carrying the Bucs throughout the season and becoming one of the best red zone players in the NFL.

Martin is also a second-year player that defenses will be game-planning for in ways they never did during his rookie campaign.

If there was a consistent quarterback in front of Martin, this wouldn't be much of an issue. He could still find holes as a runner, catch passes out of the backfield and guide Tampa Bay's offense to postseason-caliber results.

Unfortunately, consistency isn't a word in Josh Freeman's vocabulary.

During the 2012 regular season, Freeman picked up an impressive 4,065 yards and 27 touchdowns. Unfortunately, he also completed just 54.8 percent of his passes, threw 17 interceptions and committed 10 fumbles.

If any team lived by the moniker of ""Take the points when you can get them,"" it would be Tampa Bay.

Their defense is improved, Freeman has upside and Vincent Jackson is an elite receiver. Even with Martin, however, Tampa Bay is a team that trusts their kicker's ability to convert long field goals and maintain momentum",0

Picks: Maxime Comtois, Antoine Morand, Jack Badini, Kyle Olson, Olle Eriksson-Ek

Best Value: Comtois

The Ducks got very good value when they drafted Comtois. He was once seen as a top five pick, but had a disappointing draft season. The thing with Comtois is that he started the season at wing and did not produce much. In December he was shifted back to centre and had good numbers. Antoine Morand is small but very skilled. He is playing centre now, but may end up as a winger going forward.

Badini was passed over for the draft last year. While we aren't surprised that he was drafted, 91 seemed a bit early and a bit of a reach. Olson is another smaller player with skill. He plays like a buzz-saw though, as Olson is not afraid to mix things up in the corners or in front of the net. He also is talented enough to put up points. Eriksson-Ek gives the Ducks a nice goalie project to work with. He is the brother of Wild prospect Joel Eriksson Ek.

Arizona Coyotes: B +

Picks: Pierre-Olivier Joseph, Filip Westerlund, MacKenzie Entwistle, Nate Schnarr, Cameron Crotty, Noel Hoefenmayer, Michael Karow, Tyler Steenbergen, Erik Walli-Walterholm

Trades: Acquired Niklas Hjalmarsson, Acquired Derek Stepan and Antti Raanta

Best Value: Hjalmarsson

It was an interesting weekend for the Coyotes. Long-time head coach Dave Tippett was shown the door. This was followed by a slew of trades. The Coyotes got excellent value in picking up Hjalmarsson. He's a solid defensive defenceman. They gave up Connor Murphy, whose contract is nearly as big as Hjalmarsson's. Centre Laurent Dauphin was passed by many on the Coyotes depth chart. They also picked up Stepan and Raanta. Stepan is proven top six centre and Raanta will be the team's new number one goalie. The seventh overall pick and Anthony DeAngelo was a big price. Given the age of the Coyotes team, getting proven talent, and the need to hit to the cap floor, this is decent value. The value in their Saturday trade down with the Flyers was great as well, getting two extra picks while moving nine spots.

The Coyotes also had a boatload of picks. We had Joseph lower than many others did, as we see a player who does a lot of things good, but does not have a standout skill. He could be a solid NHL contributor though, but most gain weight. Westerlund was also taken quite a bit higher than where we had hm as a mid third. These two picks keep them away from an A grade. They got good value later in the draft. Entwistle is",0
"http://fate-srd.com/fate-accelerated/aspects-fate-points#establishing-facts In our game, these are often expressed with Power Facts : truths about the character's powers. Although these facts do not change the effectiveness of the uses of Approaches (your approach level and stunts impact that), the scope of what you can do is largely impacted by your Aspects, as defined by power facts. Let's look at Miss Martian , whose character sheet appears in the link.
Her power facts state that as a Martian she has the following abilities: Shape-shifting: She can change her form, completely altering her physical appearance, including her organic clothing, allowing her to mimic other people as well as adapt to different environments. Malleability: She can extend her limbs into large whips to grab things at great distance. Healing: Her shape-shifting allows her to heal faster than a human would.  Camouflage: She can change the appearance of her form (and her clothes) to match her surroundings, but she is not completely invisible. Super strength: Like all Martians, Miss Martian has strength above that of a typical human. Telepathy: Telepathy comes naturally to Martians. She can create a telepathic link with her teammates, which makes communications easier and untraceable. Megan can also telepathically connect with her Bio-Ship. Multilingualism: Megan can speak Martian and English. She can also translate languages psychically.  Telekinesis: Megan can use telekinesis to manipulate many objects with her mind. However, she can lose control when moving too many objects at once or not paying enough attention. By telekinetically moving herself, she can simulate flight.  Heat/Fire Sensitive: Miss Martian can be weakened when exposed to direct heat or fire This is, to be fair, an overwhelmingly MASSIVE list of abilities, all granted by a single aspect. Surely this is broken character compared to someone like Robin who is limited to what his wits and agility alone allows him? Yes....and no. As noted above she is still limited in the use of all of these abilities by the strength of her approaches and stunts, just like any other character. This is the beauty of Fate in many ways: even with all of these vast powers she is ultimately using the same four actions available to anyone else, and is no stronger in general at them than anyone else. It's just the permissions of what these actions can mean narratively is expanded by her powers. When we get to making characters in our game, the following questions should be addressed: What can your powers do? How do they work and/or why can you do these things? What limits can be compelled on them? As long as the three questions above can be answered, you have created a great set of powers for the game. :-) *** Next up: Approaches vs Skills in Fate .

"New England Patriots free safety Devin McCourty injured his ankle against the Houston Texans, but initial reports are that he was withheld for precautionary reasons.

McCourty had his ankle rolled on by a Texans offensive player, and the Patriots safety limped around on another play before going to the sideline. The current belief is a fairly mild sprain to the ankle, and the Herald's Jeff Howe made it clear that it isdefinitely an ankle injury and not an Achilles issue, which means that he shouldn't miss much time, if any at all.

ESPN's Mike Reiss was noted as hearing the injury ""was nothing too too bad.""

Devin McCourty gets his ankle rolled up. #patriots https://t.co/PjWsTJkan5 — Mike Loyko (@NEPD_Loyko) December 14, 2015

McCourty pulls up after non-contact. pic.twitter.com/fEZvbntnuk — Rich Hill (@PP_Rich_Hill) December 14, 2015

While it would be nice for the full defense to be on the field at any given week, it seems like McCourty should be okay and any injury shouldn't be lasting.

In other injury updates, linebacker Jonathan Freeny was seen with a cast after the game. Jerod Mayo took his role in the lineup and unsurprisingly outplayed him for yet another week. Hopefully Freeny won't miss any time, though, because he's an excellent special teams player.

Defensive tackle Dominique Easley drew attention for his injury, but he remained on the sideline and worked out on an exercise bike. It's very rare for a player to have a serious injury and to continue to remain on the field, so it's likely a minor issue that won't hold him out for much time. Since he was on a bike, it was likely trying to work out some tightness in his quad, which aligns will his leg giving out on the play.

Easley is clearly concerned about his knees and his reaction was extremely similar to Rob Gronkowski against the Broncos- anything that might be scary gets magnified a trillion times due to the history.

Running back LeGarrette Blount did not return to the field after halftime after suffering a hip injury. This will be more important to monitor as the Patriots are dangerously thin at running back. We will provide updates as they are available.",0
"The war in Ukraine has been raging for over six years now, with no end in sight. The conflict began in 2014 when Russian-backed separatists seized control of Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine, sparking a full-scale war between the Ukrainian military and separatist forces.

The fighting has been brutal, with thousands of civilians killed and many more injured or displaced from their homes. Both sides have been accused of committing war crimes, including the indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas and the use of banned weapons such as cluster bombs.

Despite numerous attempts at a ceasefire and diplomatic negotiations, the conflict has only escalated in recent months. The Ukrainian military has reported an increase in Russian military activity along the border, with fears that Moscow may be preparing for a larger-scale invasion.

The international community has condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine, with sanctions imposed and diplomatic pressure applied to try and bring an end to the conflict. However, these efforts have so far been unsuccessful, and the situation remains volatile.

The war in Ukraine is a tragedy for all involved, with innocent civilians caught in the crossfire and the prospect of a wider regional conflict looming on the horizon. It is essential that the international community continues to push for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, and that all parties involved are held accountable for their actions.",1
"Researchers over at Check Point Security have discovered a severe infection in 38 Android devices which came pre-installed, belonging to a large telecommunications company, as well as a multinational technology firm.

According to the security firm, the malware arrived before users turned on their handsets for the first time. ""The malicious apps were not part of the official ROM supplied by the vendor, and were added somewhere along the supply chain,"" the report stated. It affected many devices from various brands, which include the following:

Samsung Galaxy Note2

LG G4

Samsung Galaxy S7

Most of the malware found pre-installed on affected devices were information stealers and rough ad networks, which included a ransomware called Slocker. This crypto-malware uses AES encryption algorithm to lock a victim's files, and then demands money in exchange of unlocking them.

Check Point notes that the most notable rough adnet to target the devices is the Loki malware. ""The malware displays illegitimate advertisements to generate revenue,"" says the security firm. ""As part of its operation, the malware steals data about the device and installs itself to system, allowing it to take full control of the device and achieve persistency.""

While it is of course advised to be wary of where we download our apps, it is noted that pre-installed malware is a completely different problem to tackle. Check Point expounds further:

Pre-installed malware compromise the security even of the most careful users. In addition, a user who receives a device already containing malware will not be able to notice any change in the device's activity which often occur once a malware is installed. The discovery of the pre-installed malware raises some alarming issues regarding mobile security. Users could receive devices which contain backdoors or are rooted without their knowledge.

"Spain Introduces Innovative Educational System to Boost Student Success

Spain has recently launched an innovative educational system aimed at improving student success rates across the country. The system is designed to provide a more personalized and engaging learning experience for students, tailored to their individual needs and interests.

One of the key features of the new system is the introduction of ""competency-based learning"", which focuses on developing specific skills and knowledge that are relevant to the real world. This approach replaces the traditional model of rote memorization and standardized tests, which many experts argue is outdated and does not adequately prepare students for the challenges of the modern workforce.

Under the new system, students will have more flexibility in choosing their courses and the pace at which they progress through their studies. They will also have access to a wider range of learning resources, such as online tutorials and interactive multimedia tools.

Another important aspect of the new system is the emphasis on developing social and emotional skills. This includes promoting teamwork, communication, and problem-solving abilities, which are seen as essential for success in both academic and professional settings.

The new educational system has been welcomed by parents, teachers, and education experts alike, who believe that it will help to address some of the challenges facing Spain's education system. These challenges include high dropout rates, low levels of student engagement, and a widening achievement gap between students from different socio-economic backgrounds.

The Spanish government has also expressed its commitment to ensuring that the new system is adequately resourced and supported. This includes investing in teacher training and professional development, as well as providing additional funding for schools and educational institutions.

While it may take some time for the full impact of the new educational system to be felt, there is already a sense of optimism and excitement among educators and students alike. With its focus on personalized learning and skill development, the system has the potential to transform the way that students learn and prepare for their futures.",1

"The war in Ukraine has been ongoing since 2014, and despite numerous attempts at peace negotiations, the conflict shows no signs of abating. In recent weeks, the fighting has intensified, with both sides accusing the other of violating ceasefires and escalating the violence.

The conflict began after Ukraine's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, was ousted from power in February 2014. Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk declared independence, leading to a war that has claimed more than 13,000 lives.

The conflict has also displaced millions of people, with many forced to flee to other parts of Ukraine or neighboring countries. The war has had a devastating impact on the region's economy, with infrastructure and industries destroyed.

The latest flare-up in the conflict began in late March, with both sides blaming each other for violating the ceasefire. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of sending troops and weapons to support the separatists, while Russia denies any involvement in the conflict.

The situation has been further complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic, with both sides struggling to control the spread of the virus in areas affected by the conflict. Humanitarian aid has been hampered by the fighting, with many people unable to access basic necessities like food and medical supplies.

International efforts to resolve the conflict have so far been ineffective, with peace talks repeatedly breaking down. The United States and other Western countries have imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response to its involvement in the conflict, but these measures have had little impact on the fighting.

As the war in Ukraine continues, the toll on civilians and the region's economy grows ever greater. Without a lasting solution to the conflict, the future remains uncertain for millions of people caught in the crossfire.",1

"Washington D.C. - Senator John Smith, a prominent figure in American politics, has recently made headlines for his controversial stance on immigration reform.

Smith, a Republican from Texas, has long been known for his strong conservative views on issues such as gun control and taxation. However, his recent comments on immigration have sparked outrage among both Democrats and some members of his own party.

In a recent interview with Fox News, Smith stated that he believes the United States should limit all forms of immigration, including legal immigration. He argued that this would help to protect American jobs and preserve the country's culture.

Many have condemned Smith's comments as xenophobic and un-American. Critics have pointed out that the United States has a long history of welcoming immigrants from all over the world, and that diversity is one of the country's greatest strengths.

Several of Smith's fellow Republicans have also spoken out against his comments. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is himself a son of immigrants, called Smith's remarks ""deeply troubling"" and said they did not reflect the views of the Republican Party.

Despite the backlash, Smith has refused to back down from his stance on immigration. In a statement released on his website, he said that he stands by his comments and that he believes they reflect the will of the American people.

Smith's comments have reignited the debate over immigration reform, which has been a contentious issue in American politics for years. With the 2020 presidential election fast approaching, it is sure to remain a topic of heated discussion in the months ahead.",1
"Washington D.C. - The political sphere in the United States is abuzz with the latest developments surrounding the esteemed Senator John Smith. The 65-year-old politician, who has been a member of the United States Senate for over 20 years, has been making headlines for his recent actions and statements.

Senator Smith, who is known for his conservative views, has been at the forefront of the debate regarding the proposed changes to the healthcare system in the country. He has been vocal in his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, and has been advocating for a complete overhaul of the system.

In a recent interview, Senator Smith stated that ""The current healthcare system in our country is broken. It is failing our citizens and we need to fix it. I believe that we need to introduce market-based reforms that will increase competition and lower costs for consumers.""

Apart from his views on healthcare, Senator Smith has also been making headlines for his stance on immigration. He has been a vocal critic of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which provides temporary protection to undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children.

Senator Smith has been pushing for stricter border control measures and has been advocating for a merit-based immigration system. ""We need to make sure that we are bringing the best and the brightest to our country. We need to have a system that rewards those who are hardworking, talented, and have something to contribute to our society,"" he said in a recent press conference.

Despite receiving criticism from some quarters for his views, Senator Smith remains popular among his supporters, who believe that he is fighting for the interests of the American people.

Senator Smith's rising prominence within the Republican Party has led some to speculate that he may run for President in the next election. While he has not confirmed or denied these rumors, his recent actions and statements have certainly caught the attention of political observers across the country.

As Senator Smith continues to make waves in the political arena, it remains to be seen what the future holds for this prominent politician. One thing is for sure - he is a force to be reckoned with and his views will continue to shape the national discourse on important issues.",1
"On Monday afternoon, a fatal car accident occurred on the intersection of Main Street and Elm Street. The crash involved two vehicles, a silver sedan and a red pickup truck.

According to eyewitnesses, the silver sedan was traveling southbound on Main Street when it ran a red light and collided with the red pickup truck, which was traveling eastbound on Elm Street. The impact of the collision was so severe that both vehicles were badly damaged.

Upon arrival, emergency responders found the driver of the silver sedan, a 35-year-old woman, unresponsive. Despite their best efforts, the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of the red pickup truck, a 42-year-old man, suffered minor injuries and was transported to the hospital for treatment.

The accident caused a major traffic delay, as both streets were blocked off for several hours while police conducted their investigation and cleared the wreckage.

Authorities are urging drivers to obey all traffic signals and to exercise caution while driving on the roads. The cause of the accident is still under investigation, and it is unclear whether drugs or alcohol played a role in the crash.

"Machine Learning: The Future of Artificial Intelligence

In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in machine learning as one of the most promising technologies for the future of artificial intelligence. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves the use of algorithms that learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It has the potential to revolutionize the world we live in, from healthcare to finance, and from transportation to education.

One of the key advantages of machine learning is its ability to analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns that humans may not be able to recognize. This capability has been particularly useful in healthcare, where machine learning algorithms have been used to detect diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. By analyzing large datasets, these algorithms can identify patterns and correlations that can help doctors diagnose and treat patients more effectively.

In finance, machine learning has been used to analyze stock market data and predict market trends. This has led to the development of trading algorithms that can make better investment decisions than human traders. Additionally, machine learning algorithms have been used to detect fraud in credit card transactions and identify potential risks in lending.

The transportation industry has also seen the benefits of machine learning, particularly with the development of self-driving cars. These cars use machine learning algorithms to analyze data from sensors and cameras, enabling them to navigate roads and avoid obstacles without human intervention.

In education, machine learning has the potential to personalize learning for each student. By analyzing student data such as performance on tests, machine learning algorithms can identify areas of weakness and provide targeted instruction to help students improve.

Despite the many benefits of machine learning, there are also concerns about its potential impact on jobs and privacy. As machine learning algorithms become more advanced, they may be able to perform tasks that were previously done by humans, leading to job losses in certain industries. Additionally, the use of machine learning algorithms raises concerns about privacy, as these algorithms often require access to large amounts of personal data.

As machine learning continues to evolve, it is clear that it will play a significant role in shaping the future of artificial intelligence. While there are challenges to be addressed, the potential benefits are enormous, and we can expect to see more and more applications of machine learning in the years to come.",1

Hi all,I followed with interest the story on Robert Bogucki, the Alaskan who went for a long walk in 1999 across the north west section of the Great Sandy Desert . The story made international headlines as the search was on for him. The locals here gave up on him, perhaps rightly so. Not so his parents, who hired the 1st Special Response Group from the United States of America to go and bring him out....He was eventually found by a media helicopter in the Edgar Range near Mowla Bluff Before the news of his rescue broke , only hours before in fact, members of the 1st Special Response Group found the word ""HELP"" above a cliff in the Edgar Range Here is a picture of it from the newspaper in Perth (The West Australian) from 1999.I had often wondered where this was located, and thought I should seek it out. I asked here on Exploroz with no luck, no surprises there. So I asked the 1st Special Response Group about it and they put me in touch with David Kovar who was on the rescue mission. Mr. Kovar was extremely helpful, full of information though could not provide exact coordinates.He says, referring to a road he calls Looma Access Road, "".....base camp was off the road just to the west of the point where Looma turns south. The tarp was found approximately half a mile from the base at a bearing of approximately 80 degrees. From there, you'd proceed north until you hit a dry (at our time of year) creekbed. Then follow that to the west. Eventually you'll hit a significant drop - approximately 100 feet down. At the base of the drop was Robert's last camp and the worlds ""Help"" written in rocks.""Believe it or not, that info was enough for me to determine the ""HELP"" sign location. So land based navigators - Could you have worked it out?Mr. Kovar provided a picture, here it is:Later Mr. Kovar found some more of his notes and says, ""We came to a location at which the creek aprons out upon a large flat rock (approximately 100 by 200 feet) and ends in a hundred foot drop waterfall. We observed a ""H E L P "" sign spelled out with small rocks on the rock apron with an arrow-pointing north. From the lip of the waterfall we could observe sign and ashes of a small campfire below.""He also supplied some coordinates reinforcing his previous description:Help sign found half a mile west of this location:18 degrees 55 minutes 123 seconds South123 degrees 33 seconds 419 seconds EastThese coordinates are impossible (eg 123 seconds?? Seconds have to be in between 0 and less than 60) so once again I had to try and work out what they meant and it led me to the same spot as I had worked out previously.Anyway, on the 7 July this year I found the spot at 18 degrees 55 minutes 4.6272 seconds South, 123 degrees 33 minutes 3.7584 seconds East.Here I am at the spot where the sign was, as it has washed away. Note the tree, the hill on right and the small ranges in background.There was a huge drop and a beautiful canyon. A bit like Kings Canyon , only smaller.Dave from our party went down to the bottom, there was water there and some fish. Here he is looking across the canyon from where the HELP sign was.We couldn't drive all the way there as it was fairly hard to get down into the lower section where the canyon was. I went back to the vehicles and took these pictures of the crew coming back, and the canyon in the distance.Another one ticked off the list. Thanks a million to David Kovar.CheersAlan",0
"Jurgen Klopp is expected to bring the likes of Zeljko Buvac (left) with him to Merseyside if he becomes Liverpool manager

With Liverpool closing on a deal to make Jurgen Klopp their new manager, we look at the backroom team the German may bring with him to Anfield.

Liverpool's owners, the Fenway Sports Group, are expected to allow Klopp to hire his own assistants, likely to comprise of those who worked alongside him during his seven years at the Westfalenstadion.

MAIN ALLIES

These are Klopp's most trusted lieutenants who could follow him to Merseyside if he becomes Liverpool boss:

Peter Krawietz

Peter Krawietz is Klopp's video analyst and chief scout

Krawietz would be one of Klopp's two main assistants at Liverpool having worked alongside him at both Mainz and then Borussia Dortmund.

The 43-year-old - who never played professional football - specialises as a video analyst concentrating on his own team, as well as the opposition, while he has also been Klopp's chief scout during the course of the last 14 years.

Described by former Dortmund midfielder Paul Lambert as being ""very good"" at his job, Krawietz was promoted to be Klopp's assistant coach at Dortmund.

""Peter is a big part of his team and he was at Mainz with him. He knows him really well and is someone who he trusts to be very analytical about the game. He's someone he'll lean on,"" the Scott added.

""I also liaise with the amateurs and youth squad, and tell the people in charge what's important to the head coach,"" is how he described part of his job at the Westfalenstadion.

Zeljko Buvac

Klopp and his trusted right-hand man Zeljko Buvac, aka 'The Brain', during their time together at Dortmund

Buvac is Klopp's other key coaching ally, with the pair having known each other since 1992 when they were team-mates at Mainz.

Buvac hung up his boots in 1998, managing SC Neukirchen with little success for three years until Klopp appointed him as his assistant when he took over at the Coface Arena in 2001, before then following him to Dortmund seven years later.

The Bosnian - currently head coach of the Republika Srpska national team - is Klopp's right-hand man in charge of training sessions and is known as 'The Brain' due to his expert tactical knowledge of the game.

""Zeljko is a football genius, a master of every practice drill,"" Klopp says of his close friend, while Lambert called the 54-year-old: ""Very quiet, but excellent. I can understand why Jurgen calls him that ['The Brain']. I have seen him working; he does not say much, but is very astute on the game.""

Dortmund midfielder Nuri Sahin, who also spent a period on loan at Liverpool, says the duo have a telepathic relationship.

""Zeljko Buvac is basically Klopp's twin,"" Sahin told the Bundesliga website. ""Both of them see football in exactly the same way.""

Nuri Sahin spent five months at Anfield in the 2012-13 campaign

Klopp, Krawietz and Buvac have formed a hugely successful partnership at Mainz and Dortmund since 2001, with Lambert saying of the trio: ""They work really well and are an excellent team. You can see on the pictures just how close they are. If the three of them come over - I would be shocked if these two don't come with him to Liverpool - then I think they will be a great fit for Liverpool.""

RAIDING THE WESTFALENSTADION

However, Klopp may also want to try and persuade two other members of his coaching setup at Dortmund to join him should he agree to take the vacant manager's position at Anfield:

Wolfgang de Beer

Wolfgang de Beer is Dortmund's goalkeeping coach

De Beer kept goal for Dortmund for 15 years before a serious knee injury forced him to hang up his gloves in 2001, with the German going on to become the Bundesliga club's goalkeeping coach a year later.

The 51-year-old stayed at the Signal Iduna Park following Klopp's departure at the end of last season, so it is not known whether he would follow him to Merseyside or not.

Andreas Beck

Andreas Beck is currently one of Dortmund's fitness coaches

Klopp brought Beck to Dortmund as one of the club's three main fitness coaches in 2012, a position he had held for the previous five years at 1.FC Nurnberg, with his main responsibilities being to warm the players",0
"Machine Learning: The Future of Artificial Intelligence

In recent years, artificial intelligence has become an increasingly important field of study. One of the most exciting areas of research within this field is machine learning, a technique that allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time.

At its core, machine learning involves training algorithms to recognize patterns and make predictions based on large amounts of data. This ability to learn and adapt makes machine learning systems incredibly powerful and versatile, with applications ranging from natural language processing to self-driving cars.

One of the key advantages of machine learning is its ability to automate complex tasks that would otherwise require human intervention. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze medical images and detect early signs of disease, or to monitor industrial equipment and predict maintenance needs before they become critical.

In addition to its practical applications, machine learning is also driving significant advances in fundamental scientific research. By using machine learning to analyze large datasets, researchers are able to make new discoveries and gain insights into complex systems that would be impossible to obtain through traditional methods.

However, as with any new technology, there are also concerns about the potential risks and ethical implications of machine learning. For example, there is a risk that machine learning algorithms could be biased or make decisions that are harmful to certain groups of people.

To address these concerns, researchers and policymakers are working to develop new ethical frameworks and guidelines for the use of machine learning. These efforts will be critical in ensuring that machine learning continues to be used in a responsible and beneficial way.

Overall, the development of machine learning represents a major milestone in the evolution of artificial intelligence. With its ability to learn and adapt over time, machine learning is poised to revolutionize many different industries and transform the way we live and work in the years to come.",1
"New Study Reveals the Benefits of Walking for Brain Health

A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association has shed new light on the benefits of walking for brain health. The study, which involved over 4,000 participants, found that walking for at least 30 minutes a day can improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of cognitive decline.

The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, followed participants over a 13-year period. The researchers found that those who walked for at least 30 minutes a day had a 50% lower risk of developing cognitive decline compared to those who did not walk at all. They also found that walking was associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline in those who already had cognitive impairment.

The study’s lead author, Dr. Kirk Erickson, commented on the results, stating, “Our findings suggest that walking has the potential to be an effective, low-cost intervention to improve brain health and reduce the risk of cognitive decline",1
"Some Chicago residents are fed up with the city's pothole problem so they are taking matters into their own hands. Residents and members of a community group are fixing the holes themselves. The South Austin Coalition is helping residents make rides on their pock-marked streets a little smoother by providing the material needed to fill potholes.

Potholes are everywhere. Many Chicagoans say they have to drive in the city looking down to see potholes, and that is not considered the safe way to drive. How do you avoid them? Some residents have decided to do their part. They believe the Chicago Department of Transportation is not repairing potholes fast enough, and they have become dangerous.

""You can't walk out there. You walking out there in the street at night, you can fall down and break your arm,"" said Florida Vaires, concerned Austin resident.

""The city hasn't done anything about the potholes on this block. Members of the community are taking matters into their own hands instead of doing it themselves,"" said Elce Redmond, South Austin Coalition Community Council.

Angry residents of the South Austin Coalition Community Council, who live in the 4800-block West Van Buren, have decided to take the pothole situation into their own hands and have started repairing potholes themselves. The coalition is supplying the blacktop to fill them and the residents are doing the work.

""I'm proud of these people. These people are trying to get the streets together, because it seems like the city is not doing anything around these type of neighborhoods,"" said Antoine Noifleet, Austin resident.

""In the last two months on the 4800-block of West Van Buren, we've received just one call about potholes,"" said Brian Steele, Chicago Department of Transportation.

""We are inundated with potholes, very dangerous potholes,"" said Redmond.

CDOT does not recommend residents fill the potholes for a number of reasons.

""Safety. We don't want people out on the street among active traffic. Secondly, we don't know what type of material they're using,"" Steele said.

The big question is who is responsible legally if someone gets hurt or destroys their car on a pothole repaired by a resident.

""That's a very good question, one I don't have an answer to. That's the reason why infrastructure repairs are under the purview and the responsibility of the city,"" said Steele.

""Are we willing to take responsibility? That's a good question, and one I have to look at in terms of our legal department,"" Redmond said.

Potholes can be found across the city. ABC7 drove to other blocks in the Austin Community and found potholes then went to the north Side and found too many to count.

Avoiding them can take work and they can destroy your car.

""The city has not received state funding for arterial street resurfacing since 2006. Typically we would do about 30, 40 miles of street resurfacing. We haven't been able to do that the last three years. That's starting to take its toll,"" said Steele.

Austin residents say they will continue to fill the potholes on their own.

The Chicago Department of Transportation says they are aggressively attacking potholes. They have filled over 300,000 since December 1 and fill close to 5,000 a day. The problem is there are too many.

Officials say the federal stimulus package will help the city resurface over 40 miles of streets, and the state will also provide money for over 100 miles of resurfacing, so help is on the way.",0
"Welcome to the first installment of Peak Civ, an original column by Kevin Tucker that takes on the news from an anti-civilization perspective, only on It's Going Down.

""Civilizations are artificial cultural constructions, not biological organisms, and they would be poor biological performers if we insisted on considering them as organisms."" – John Bodley, The Power of Scale

The goal here is to provide an anarcho-primitivist analysis to our dumpster fire of a reality. In nearly every realm of civilized life, the world we are sold is bursting at the seams. Daily life feels like a perpetual onslaught of depressing news and calamities, that's because it is. The history of civilization is a timeline of the consolidation of power from the mouths of priests to the coding of programmers.

Our lineage, as nomadic hunter-gatherers, still shapes the way we see, interact and understand the world. That is a lineage shaped by millions of years of egalitarian, anarchistic existence. That is a lineage that defines each of us, but is perpetually being torn apart, repackaged and sold to us through the domestication process. It keeps us from existing with the greater wild community as capable beings finding our wants and needs within each other. Ultimately turning us into consumers putting our wants and needs over each other.

Anarchism needs ecology.

If we want to understand power, if we want to understand where and how inequality arises, then we need to stop granting the illusions of the power-hungry. The State exists because it has bent carrying capacity, prolonged itself (albeit temporarily) through agriculture and technological intrusions. The State had to create the concept of nature as a separate place so that it could have us believe that civilization had conquered it. That the State was no longer held to the same realities of ecology.

Anarchism needs ecology because we need to understand that the oppression and domination of the State don't start and stop with human lives.

The reality is that we are animals. And the State is a construct upheld by physical infrastructure. It is real, no doubt. But its ideological disconnect doesn't make it true. As the industrial vigor amplified the ecological consequences of agriculture, the earth and its fluid balance began to take the hit. As forest felling timber-based fuel led way to coal mining and on to fossil fuels and nuclear power, that wound opens wider. As communities are broken down into laborers turned into slaves, that pain feels more personal.

As we are learning, we are not exempt from that wound. While the first flood of climate refugees face increasingly hostile borders and rampant xenophobia, it is clear that the fate of humanity is not separate from the fate of the wild world. Deny though we might, it doesn't stop reality.

Anarchism needs ecology because we need to understand that the oppression and domination of the State don't start and stop with human lives. If we want to understand civilization, the states that define it and the agriculture that underpins it, then we need to understand how biological organisms function. Civilization is not living, but it is parasitic. It exists on a finite planet, it bleeds its resources and communities, but it cannot exist without them. If we want to take on civilization, the State or any form of political power, then we need to see it in the way it refuses to acknowledge: an organization built upon the very ecology it denies.

The weakness of political power lies in seeing it outside of its own narrative. If you want to solve a crime, you follow the money. If you want to stop the powerful, you follow the fuel. We are all connected: our past, our present, our futures, and our fate.

Conversely, ecology needs anarchism.

Ecologists, biologists, and environmentalists can equally feed into the notion of nature as an abstraction. Many are willing to recognize that we too are animals, but they forget that we can do anything about it. Absorbed by political and corporate entities, they are fighting for an expansion of rights, for value within the terms of the State. The default becomes relying on NGOs or research that is either a corporate tax or, worse, the philanthropists' tithe.

From this view, the feed of disturbing news feels no less daunting. It might feel a little more frightening. But within that, there's the reminder that we are never alone in this.

The narratives of political power become the baseline understanding for humanity and the world. Biologists tend to regurgitate myths of domination and subservience within the wild to justify ourselves with our own captivity. They seek to anthropomorphize the wild to universalize our political dynamics so that even in the wild there is no escape. Socio-biologists, social Darwinists: narratives like Richard Dawkin's ""selfish gene"" seek to naturalize the historical creation that is civilization.

"Tragedy Strikes as Car Collides with Pedestrian

A quiet morning in the suburban town of Oakville turned into a scene of horror as a car collided with a pedestrian at the intersection of Main Street and Park Avenue. The accident occurred around 9:30 am, causing a brief traffic jam and commotion among the onlookers.

Eyewitnesses reported that the pedestrian, identified as 62-year-old Mary Johnson, was crossing the street when a grey sedan speeding down Main Street struck her. The collision caused Johnson to sustain serious injuries, including multiple fractures and head trauma. She was immediately rushed to the nearby Oakville General Hospital, where she underwent emergency surgery.

The driver of the sedan, 30-year-old Mark Thompson, was taken into custody by the Oakville Police Department. Authorities stated that he was cooperative with the investigation and showed no signs of intoxication or impairment. The cause of the accident is still under investigation, and charges against Thompson are pending.

The incident has left the Oakville community in shock and mourning. Johnson, a beloved member of the community, is known for her warm personality and dedication to charity work. Her family members and friends have expressed their deep sorrow and shock at the sudden turn of events.

Oakville Mayor John Smith has released a statement expressing his condolences and urging the residents to remain cautious while driving or walking on the streets. ""We are deeply saddened by this tragic accident and extend our heartfelt sympathies to Ms. Johnson's family and friends. We urge all residents to take extra care while on the streets, and to be mindful of the safety of others.""

The accident has once again highlighted the importance of road safety and the need for drivers and pedestrians to exercise caution and obey traffic rules. Authorities have urged the public to remain vigilant and take all necessary precautions to avoid accidents on the streets.",1
"In just 10 years, we may live in a world where there are sensors in the walls of our houses, in our clothes and even in our brains.

Forget thinking about the Internet of Things where your coffee maker and refrigerator are connected. By 2025, we could very well live in a trillion-device world.

[ Stay up to date on tech news with Computerworld's daily newsletters. ]

That's the prediction from Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California at Berkeley.

""Smartness can be embedded everywhere,"" said Sangiovanni-Vincentelli. ""The entire environment is going to be full of sensors of all kinds. Chemical sensors, cameras and microphones of all types and shapes. Sensors will check the quality of the air and temperatures. Microphones around your environment will listen to you giving commands.""

This is going to be a world where connected devices and sensors are all around us -- even inside us, Sangiovanni-Vincentelli said in an interview with Computerworld during DARPA's Wait, what? Forum on future technology in St. Louis this week.

""It's actually exciting,"" he said. ""In the next 10 years, it's going to be tremendous.""

According to the Berkeley professor and researcher, we won't have just smartphones.

We'll have a swarm of sensors that are intelligent and interconnected.

Most everything in our environment -- from clothing to furniture and our very homes -- could be smart. Sensors could be mixed with paint and spread onto our walls.

We'll just speak out loud and information will instantly be given to us without having to do an online search, phone calls can be made or a robot could start to clean or make dinner.

And with sensors implanted in our brains , we wouldn't even need to speak out loud to interact with our smart environment.

Want something? Just think about it.

""The brain-machine interface will have sensors placed in our brains, collecting information about what we think and transmitting it to this complex world that is surrounding us,"" said Sangiovanni-Vincentelli. ""I think I'd like to have an espresso and then here comes a nice little robot with a steaming espresso because I thought about it.""

Pam Melroy, deputy director of DARPA's Tactical Technology Office, said the Berkeley professor isn't just dreaming.

""I do think there's something to that"" scenario, said Melroy, who is a retired U.S. Air Force officer and former NASA astronaut. ""At the very least, we should be preparing for it and thinking of what is needed. We get into very bad places when technology outstrips our planning and thinking. I'd rather worry about that and prepare for it even if it takes 20 years to come true, than just letting it evolve in a messy way.""

While having a trillion-device life could happen in as little as 10 years, Sangiovanni-Vincentelli said there's a lot of work to be done to get there.

First, we simply don't have the network we'd need to support this many connected devices.

We would need communication protocols that consume very small amounts of energy and can transmit fluctuating amounts of information, the professor explained. Businesses would need to build massive numbers of tiny, inexpensive sensors. We'll need more and better security to fend off hacks to our clothing, walls and brains.

And the cloud will have to be grown out to handle all of the data that these trillion devices will create.

""Once you have the technology enabling all of this, we should be there in 10 years,"" said Sangiovanni-Vincentelli.

With all of these devices, many people will be anxious about what this means for personal privacy.

Sangiovanni-Vincentelli won't be one of them, though.

""Lack of privacy is not an issue,"" he said. ""We've already lost it all... If the government wants me now, they have me. Everything is already recorded somewhere. What else is there to lose?""

Melroy also is more excited than nervous about this increasingly digital future.

""As a technologist, I don't fear technology,"" she said. ""I think having ways that make us healthier and more efficient are a good thing... There is social evolution that happens with technological evolution. We once were worried about the camera and the privacy implications of taking pictures of people. The challenge is to make the pace of change match the social evolution.""",0

Two injured in car crash on Main Street

Two people were injured in a car crash that occurred on Main Street yesterday afternoon. The accident happened at around 3 p.m. near the intersection with Elm Street and involved two vehicles, a sedan and an SUV.

According to the preliminary investigation by the police, the driver of the sedan, identified as John Smith, 35, was traveling westbound on Main Street when he apparently failed to yield at a stop sign and collided with the SUV, which was heading southbound on Elm Street. The SUV, driven by Mary Jones, 42, was carrying two passengers, her husband and their son, but they were not injured.

Smith and his passenger, who has not been named, were both taken to the hospital by ambulance. Smith suffered a broken arm and several cuts and bruises, while his passenger had a head injury and a broken leg. Their conditions were not immediately available, but they were said to be stable.

The crash caused significant damage to both vehicles and disrupted traffic in the area for about an hour. The police had to close off the affected lanes of Main Street and redirect vehicles through side streets. Witnesses reported hearing a loud bang and seeing smoke and debris flying in the air.

Some nearby residents expressed concern about the safety of the intersection, which they said had seen several accidents in the past due to its confusing layout and inadequate signage. They called for the city to improve the visibility and markings of the stop signs and to consider installing traffic lights or speed bumps.

The police said that the investigation was ongoing and that they had not yet determined the cause of the crash. They urged anyone who witnessed the accident or had any information to come forward and contact them.

The accident serves as a reminder of the importance of obeying traffic rules and being alert and cautious while driving, especially in busy areas. Motorists are advised to always check their surroundings, signal their intentions, and yield to other vehicles and pedestrians as required by law.",1
"As the conflict in Ukraine continues to rage on, the world remains deeply concerned about the toll this conflict is taking on the Ukrainian people. The war in Ukraine, which began in 2014, has claimed thousands of lives and displaced millions of people, leaving an indelible mark on the country.

The conflict began in 2014, when pro-Russian rebels seized control of Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula, and declared it part of the Russian Federation. The Ukrainian government, backed by the West, has since been fighting to regain control of the region.

Since then, the fighting has spread to other parts of Ukraine, particularly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where pro-Russian separatists have taken up arms against the Ukrainian government. Ukrainian soldiers and civilians alike have been caught in the crossfire, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.

The war has had a devastating impact on the Ukrainian people, with many losing their homes, businesses, and livelihoods. The humanitarian situation in the country remains dire, with many people lacking access to basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare.

The international community has been watching the conflict closely, with many countries denouncing Russia's annexation of Crimea and providing support to Ukraine's government. The United States and European Union have imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine, and have provided Ukraine with military and economic aid.

Despite these efforts, the conflict shows no signs of abating. The toll on the Ukrainian people continues to mount, and the future of the country remains uncertain. As the war in Ukraine enters its eighth year, it is clear that a lasting solution will only be possible through diplomacy and a commitment to finding a peaceful resolution to this devastating conflict.",1
"Fatal Accident on Highway 101 Claims Three Lives

On Wednesday evening, a tragic accident occurred on Highway 101, resulting in the deaths of three people. The crash occurred around 6:30 pm near the intersection of Highway 101 and Main Street.

According to witnesses, a vehicle traveling northbound on the highway crossed over the median and collided head-on with a southbound vehicle. The impact of the crash was severe, and both vehicles were completely destroyed.

"In recent years, there has been much discussion surrounding the educational system of the European country of Finland. Known for its innovative and forward-thinking approach, Finland's system has gained international recognition as one of the best in the world.

One of the key aspects of Finland's educational system is its emphasis on equal opportunities and accessibility. Children in Finland are entitled to free education, including pre-primary education, which starts at the age of six. The curriculum is designed to cater to the individual needs of each student, with a strong emphasis on developing critical thinking skills and creativity.

Another unique aspect of Finland's educational system is the emphasis on play-based learning for young children. Rather than focusing on formal academic instruction, young children are encouraged to learn through play, exploration, and social interaction. This approach has been shown to have a positive impact on children's cognitive, social, and emotional development.

Finland's educational system also places a strong emphasis on teacher training and support. Teachers in Finland are highly qualified, with all teachers required to have a master's degree. The government provides extensive support and resources for teacher training and professional development, ensuring that teachers have the skills and knowledge needed to provide high-quality education to their students.

Perhaps one of the most striking aspects of Finland's educational system is its focus on equity. There are no private schools in Finland, and all schools are publicly funded. This means that students from all backgrounds have access to the same high-quality education, regardless of their family's income or social status.

Overall, Finland's educational system serves as an excellent example of how a focus on equity, accessibility, and innovation can lead to high-quality education for all students. As other countries look to improve their own educational systems, Finland's approach provides valuable lessons on how to create an inclusive and effective system that benefits students and society as a whole.",1

"La Sirena Cigars is fully owned and operated by Arielle Ditkowich as of January 1, 2014. Below is the full brand history:

The La Sirena Story began in 2006 in New York City when Nestor Miranda met Arielle Ditkowich at an event. He was immediately taken by her love of tobacco, desire to learn more and the way she connected with people. Over the course of time he took her under his wing and they both learned from each other about the changing cigar market as well as the cigars that people demanded.

In early 2008, the two decided to produce a cigar that would fit the profile of what today's cigar aficionado wanted. At a roundtable discussion names were being discussed, when Arielle asked, ""What is the spanish word for Mermaid"". The answer was, ""La Sirena"".

With the name in place and a desire to create a full bodied cigar, the team set off for Esteli, Nicaragua where they began working with the Garcia family at My Father Cigars. Over the course of the next few months countless blends were smoked and finally the blend that fit the profile that La Sirena was seeking was found.

Later that year, at the IPCPR in New Orleans, the cigar made it's debut as a gift to those who visited the Miami Cigar & Co. booth. The feedback received from members of the media as well as retailers was outstanding and it was now time to set sail full steam ahead.

In 2009, La Sirena was officially released and today it continues to be requested at many tobacconists nationwide. The brand followed up with its second release in 2012, Merlion, created by La Aurora in the Dominican Republic with the medium bodied, full flavored smoker in mind.

After a successful 3-year partnership, Ditkowich was ready to spread her La Sirena wings and became an independent company.

"LOS ANGELES -- Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler wants consumers to be able to say goodbye to their cable set-top boxes.

In a Los Angeles Times op-ed piece published Thursday, Wheeler is proposing a new rule that would require cable and satellite video companies to offer consumers the option to receive their channels through apps that provide streaming video over the Internet. Consumers have long chafed at having to pay for set-top boxes to get a cable signal.

""If adopted, consumers will no longer have to rent a set-top box, month after month,"" Wheeler wrote. ""Instead, pay-TV providers will be required to provide apps -- free of charge -- that consumers can download to the device of their choosing to access all the programming and features they already paid for.""

Wheeler's proposal comes six months after the Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 along party lines to begin crafting rules intended to spur competition in the set-top box market by developing technology standards so that third-party devices and apps could decode pay-TV signals.

Such a service would enable consumers to watch cable channels over on an Internet-connected television or device such as an Xbox, Roku or AppleTV.

Cable and satellite companies collect a combined $20 billion annually in rental fees, adding to the overall cost of cable or satellite service. Wheeler cited an analysis that said consumers pay an average of $231 annually for the use of a box.

Wheeler's plan was praised by consumer groups but met with strong criticism by the cable industry. The companies and their trade group, the NationalCable and Telecommunications Assocation, characterized Wheeler's plan as an act of government overreach that goes beyond the FCC's authority.

""This proposal would far exceed the Commission's legal authority and improperly insert the government into private contract negotiations between payTV distributors, content creators and device manufacturers,"" the NCTA said in a statement.

Wheeler, who has long been an advocate of bringing down the cost of video service to consumers, said studies have shown that 84 percent of consumers believe their cable bill is too high. About 99 percent of the nation's 100 million pay-TV subscribers rent at least one set-top box.

""We keep paying these charges even after the cost of the box has been recovered because we have no meaningful alternative,"" he said.

Wheeler also believes the industry needs to adapt to the technological changes that have already upended the television industry through the increased number of programming choices they have provided. A rapidly growing number of consumers, especially in the 18 to 34 age group, are turning to online streaming for their video content and want more options through Internet platforms.

""This proposal is an important step in giving consumers new, innovative choices in a market that's had limited -- if any -- competition for years,"" Consumers Union said in a statement.

Wheeler's plan gives large pay TV providers, such as Comcast and DirecTV, two years to offer streaming apps to their customers. Medium-sized companies would have an additional two years while smaller providers would be exempt.

About 90 percent of cable and satellite customers are served by the companies that will have to adopt the service in two years.

Cable companies already have the technology that offers their channels through apps, but the rental of a set-top box is required.

Opposition from the cable industry, which has been anticipating Wheeler's move, came quickly after his official announcement. Comcast, the largestcable provider in the U.S., said the proposed regulation would hurt the technological development of apps.

""Heavy-handed government technology mandates have a long history of failure,"" the company said in a statement. ""The Chairman's approach would likely meet the same fate, while causing real damage to the thriving apps marketplace and real harm to consumers.""

Charter Communications called Wheeler's plan ""a valid goal,"" but argued the marketplace is already meeting consumer demand for apps that provide video service. ""The FCC's mandate threatens to bog down with regulations and bureaucracy the entire TV app market that consumers are increasingly looking to for innovation, choice and competition,"" the company said in a statement.

It's not clear whether Wheeler's proposal will be approved by the FCC. Comissioner Michael O'Rielly echoed the concerns of the industry.

""I will review this proposal carefully over the coming days and weeks, but at the outset it appears to exist within a fantasy world of unlimited Commission authority,"" he said. ""The Commission is and must remain in the business of licensing spectrum and infrastructure, not content.""

MPAA Chairman and Chief Executive Chris Dodd said he will need assurance that an FCC mandate to provide streaming apps does not interfere with the ability of program producers and creators to negotiate issues related to online usage of their content.

""The FCC must not encroach upon copyright holders' discretion in how they exercise or license the exclusive rights,"" Dodd said.

Wheeler's proposal did receive praise",0
"The Educational System in Finland: A Model for the World

Finland, a Nordic country with a population of 5.5 million, has been consistently ranked as having one of the best educational systems in the world. The Finnish system emphasizes equal opportunities and support for all students, regardless of socio-economic background, and has been praised for its innovative approach to teaching and learning.

One of the most notable aspects of Finland's educational system is its lack of standardized testing. Instead of relying on high-stakes exams to measure student performance, Finnish teachers use a variety of methods, such as regular assessments and portfolios, to evaluate students' progress. This approach fosters a culture of collaboration and supports the development of critical thinking skills.

Another key feature of the Finnish system is its emphasis on teacher training and support. All Finnish teachers are required to have a master's degree, and the country provides extensive professional development opportunities for teachers throughout their careers. Additionally, teachers are given significant autonomy in the classroom, which allows them to tailor their instruction to the needs of their students.

Finland's commitment to equity is also evident in its approach to special education. Special needs students are integrated into regular classrooms, and teachers receive specialized training to ensure that they can meet the needs of all students. This approach has been shown to lead to better outcomes for special needs students and helps to reduce stigma and discrimination.

The results of Finland's educational system speak for themselves. Finnish students consistently perform well on international assessments, such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), and have high rates of graduation and post-secondary education enrollment. Additionally, Finland has strong social mobility, meaning that students from low-income families have a good chance of achieving academic success.

While every country's educational system is unique, Finland's system provides valuable lessons for other countries looking to improve their own systems. By prioritizing teacher training, equity, and innovation, Finland has created an educational system that truly works for all students.",1
"In the world of politics, few names command as much attention as that of Senator Jane Smith. The charismatic leader has been making waves on Capitol Hill since she was first elected to office in 2008, and she shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.

Senator Smith's rise to prominence has been nothing short of meteoric. Born and raised in a small town in the Midwest, she attended a local community college before transferring to a state university to complete her degree. After graduation, she worked in a variety of jobs before deciding to run for office.

Since her election, Senator Smith has been a tireless advocate for a wide range of issues. She has been a vocal supporter of healthcare reform, environmental protections, and increasing funding for education. Her ability to build coalitions across party lines has earned her praise from both Democrats and Republicans.

Most recently, Senator Smith made headlines for her work on a bill aimed at increasing funding for mental health services. The legislation, which she co-authored with a Republican colleague, was hailed as a bipartisan victory and a much-needed step forward in addressing the mental health crisis in the country.

Despite her many achievements, Senator Smith is not without her detractors. Some critics have accused her of being too liberal, while others have raised concerns about her stance on certain social issues. However, her supporters argue that her commitment to social justice and economic equality has made her a champion of the people.

Looking ahead, Senator Smith shows no signs of slowing down. She has already announced her intention to seek re-election in the upcoming midterm elections, and many political observers believe that she has her sights set on higher office in the future. Whatever her next move may be, there is no doubt that Senator Jane Smith will continue to be a force to be reckoned with in the world of politics.",1
"Generative AI: A Game-Changer in the World of Technology

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a hot topic in the world of technology for many years. But one of the most exciting areas of development in recent times is generative AI. This technology is revolutionizing the way we create, design, and produce content, and it has the potential to change the world as we know it.

Generative AI is a system that uses machine learning algorithms to generate new content such as text, images, and even music. It works by analyzing patterns and data sets to create something new that is unique and original. This technology has already been used to create everything from paintings to video games, and it has the potential to transform many industries.

One of the most promising areas for generative AI is in the field of medicine. It has been used to create new drugs and treatments by analyzing large amounts of medical data to identify patterns and trends. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we treat diseases and save lives.

Another area where generative AI is making a significant impact is in the creative arts. This technology has been used to create music, video games, and even entire films. It has the potential to transform the entertainment industry by creating new forms of content that were previously impossible to produce.

Generative AI also has the potential to change the way we design and create products. This technology can be used to generate new ideas and designs that are tailored to a specific customer’s needs. This will revolutionize the manufacturing industry by making it possible to create highly personalized products that are tailored to individual customers.

The potential of generative AI is enormous, but there are also concerns about the impact it may have on society. Some experts worry that this technology could lead to job losses and economic disruption. However, others argue that generative AI will create new jobs and industries that we cannot even imagine yet.

Despite the concerns, the potential of generative AI is too great to ignore. This technology has the potential to change the world in ways that we cannot yet imagine. It is up to us to ensure that we use it responsibly and ethically to create a better future for all.",1

"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has been making headlines for several years now. What began as a pro-European Union protest in 2014 escalated into a full-blown war between the Ukrainian government and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.

The war has left thousands of people dead and displaced millions of others, causing significant political and economic instability in the region. The conflict has also strained relations between Ukraine and Russia, as well as between Russia and the international community.

The situation in eastern Ukraine remains tense, with regular outbreaks of violence and sporadic ceasefire agreements that are often violated by both sides. Despite international efforts to find a peaceful solution, the conflict shows no signs of ending anytime soon.

The conflict has also had a significant impact on the Ukrainian economy. The country has been forced to divert resources from other areas to fund the war effort, causing significant economic hardship for many Ukrainians. The war has also had a negative impact on foreign investment, further straining the country's already fragile economy.

As the war continues, the international community remains divided over how to best address the situation. While some countries have imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response to its involvement in the conflict, others have called for a more diplomatic approach.

Despite the challenges, however, the Ukrainian government remains committed to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict. In recent months, there have been signs of progress, with both sides agreeing to prisoner exchanges and other confidence-building measures.

As the war in Ukraine continues, it remains a stark reminder of the ongoing tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as well as the challenges facing the international community in addressing conflicts around the world.",1

"Scientists make breakthrough discovery in renewable energy

In a groundbreaking new study published in the Journal of Renewable Energy, a team of researchers have discovered a new method for harvesting renewable energy. The team, led by Professor Jane Smith at the University of California, has developed a technique for capturing energy from the movement of ocean waves.

The research team has been working on this project for the past five years, and their efforts have finally paid off. Their method involves the use of specially designed turbines that can be placed underwater to capture the energy from ocean waves. These turbines are connected to generators that convert the kinetic energy into electricity.

According to Professor Smith, this new technique has the potential to revolutionize the way we harness renewable energy. ""Our method has several advantages over traditional wind and solar power,"" she explained. ""For one, it is not dependent on weather conditions like wind or sunlight. It also has the potential to generate much more energy than other renewable sources.""

The team's research has already attracted the attention of",1
"Andy Dalton is basically Peyton Manning, Jr. Or something. (USATSI)

When you think of Peyton Manning -- even the FIESTY 2014 version -- you think of an all-time great signal callers, a legend in the pocket, gigantic, red forehead marks and the word elite. Andy Dalton? Not so much minus the redhead part anyway.

But turns out, as NBC noted on Sunday night when Dalton's Bengals played the Cardinals, the two have remarkably similar numbers through three years in the NFL.

Dalton and Peyton Manning's numbers in the first 3 years of their careers are remarkably similar #SNF pic.twitter.com/1bqeM8B314 — SNF on NBC (@SNFonNBC) August 25, 2014

Now none of this means Dalton will go on to become the next Manning. It's much easier to throw touchdown passes in this day and age and the Bengals certainly offer a better opportunity for success than Manning's Colts.

But it also points to the fact that Dalton is an undervalued property in the NFL. He gets ripped for never winning a playoff game and for having great weapons and a great defense. But the guy has put up some good numbers his first three years.",0
"The war in Ukraine has been ongoing since 2014, and it continues to be a major source of conflict and tension in the region. The conflict began when Russian-backed separatists seized control of Crimea, a Ukrainian territory, and then expanded their territory into the eastern regions of Ukraine.

Since then, the conflict has escalated into a full-scale war, with both sides engaging in violent clashes and shelling. According to the United Nations, over 13,000 people have been killed and over 30,000 have been injured since the conflict began.

Despite numerous attempts at peace negotiations, the war in Ukraine shows no signs of ending anytime soon. The Ukrainian government has accused Russia of providing military support to the separatists, while Russia denies any involvement in the conflict.

The war has had a devastating impact on the people of Ukraine, particularly those living in the conflict zones. Many have been forced to flee their homes and are now living in overcrowded and underfunded refugee camps. The conflict has also severely damaged the country's economy, with many businesses closing down and unemployment rates skyrocketing.

International organizations, including the United Nations and the European Union, have condemned the violence and called for a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, with both sides unwilling to compromise, it is unclear when the violence will come to an end.

The war in Ukraine has become a major geopolitical issue, with tensions between Russia and the West escalating as a result. The conflict has also raised questions about the effectiveness of international institutions such as the United Nations in resolving conflicts.

In conclusion, the war in Ukraine continues to be a major source of conflict and suffering in the region. While diplomatic efforts continue to be made, it is unclear when a peaceful solution will be reached. Until then, the people of Ukraine continue to suffer the devastating consequences of this ongoing conflict.",1

"If I had to choose one word to describe Killing Floor 2, it's gruesome. It's a cooperative, zombie-killing shooter that aims to produce realism in its weaponry and environments, but all of that is buried under the blood and gore of the monsters you kill. There are many interesting things about the game from the preview I saw recently, from a huge number of animations for each gun and each enemy, to a deep perk system that makes you strategize and pick a combination of abilities to play with. But I barely gave these promising elements a thought, because, in this game, gratuitous violence masks what otherwise seems to be a good, competent shooter.

Developer Tripwire claims that it's putting a lot of effort into making better, more varied guns and melee weapons. From my short look at the game, the team is on the right track. Guns are precisely modeled to be nearly identical to their real-life counterparts in both appearance and behavior. Separate gun parts move independently of one another, so that when you look down a gun's sights, the barrel sways differently than the body. Buckles on the sides of guns jump around as you fire.

And the levels are beautiful. Water reflects light from street lamps as sparks fly and lights flash. Each level has its own story to tell: one shows you how the monsters are created, another presents a decimated and abandoned Paris filled with hints of the people who lived there before.

However, these levels literally get covered in blood. When you shoot an enemy, its wound trails crimson until it dies. Unlike other games, this blood never fades. For the entire game, the pools of blood stick around, growing bigger and bigger until the ground and the walls are nothing more than canvases of red. Instead of looking upon a visually impressive, dynamic level, you're looking at a sea of blood.

This is just one part of a brand new gore system that Tripwire has implemented in Killing Floor 2. Called the M.E.A.T. System (Massive Evisceration And Trauma), it aims to make each shot brutal and destructive. Instead of five points of dismemberment as in the original Killing Floor, KF2 features nineteen. A monster's head has five places alone where it can be fragmented, and if you're accurate enough, you can blow off pieces of the skull to expose the brain. If you opt to use a shotgun instead of a precision weapon, you'll be greeted with even more gore. Raking a zombie with shotgun shells can tear it in half.

And there's no need to try to keep zombies alive if you want to see their bodies break apart: dead bodies can still be fully dismembered. The developer even showcased one instance in which a shotgun blast launched a monster up into the air, and then using slow motion the player juggled the body by shooting it, breaking it apart before it hit the ground.

The evisceration was so pervasive that it seemed gratuitous. I couldn't focus on anything else, even though there seems to be a good game in Killing Floor 2. Without the M.E.A.T. system, the game is a cooperative shooter with stunning levels, lovingly crafted guns, and a deep perk system. Tripwire has also overhauled enemy AI to give each creature type unique abilities that change with the difficulty you're playing on. Shooting looks good, environments are beautiful, and the enemies are appropriately scary.

With the extreme violence, it seemed like almost more of a circus show, a display of the twisted and broken anatomy of these monsters. Tripwire has a good foundation for a game in Killing Floor 2. Now, they have to prove that they can balance the gruesome violence with the rest of the game when it launches this year for PC. As it stands now, painting a level in blood only made me forget about the entertaining game underneath.",0

"BOISE - Idaho Gov. C. L. ""Butch"" Otter on Tuesday vetoed legislation that would have expressly permitted the use of the Bible in public school instruction, calling the measure unconstitutional.

In the veto's accompanying letter Otter said he respected the Bible, but the measure would result in costly litigation for Idaho's public schools. He said the measure directly contradicts Idaho's Constitution.

The bill stated the Bible could be used for reference purposes in subjects like literature, history, music and world geography in public schools, but not scientific subjects.

Schools are already allowed to reference the Bible and other religious texts, but this legislation specifically mentioned the Bible.

"Mathematics: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of the Universe

Mathematics is a subject that has fascinated humans for millennia. Its importance in our daily lives cannot be overstated, as it is used in everything from calculating the tip on a restaurant bill to designing complex engineering systems. But the true power of mathematics lies in its ability to unlock the secrets of the universe.

From ancient times, humans have used mathematics to make sense of the world around them. The ancient Egyptians used mathematics to construct the pyramids, while the ancient Greeks used it to develop the principles of geometry. In the modern era, mathematics has been used to develop everything from the technology that powers our smartphones to the algorithms that drive our social media feeds.

But perhaps the most exciting applications of mathematics are in the fields of science and engineering. Mathematics is used to describe the fundamental laws of the universe, from the behavior of subatomic particles to the motion of celestial bodies. It is the language of physics, allowing us to model and predict the behavior of everything from the tiniest particles to the largest structures in the cosmos.

In engineering, mathematics is used to design and optimize everything from airplanes to bridges to medical devices. By using mathematical modeling, engineers can simulate the behavior of complex systems and test different designs before building them in the real world. This allows for more efficient and cost-effective design processes, as well as safer and more reliable products.

At the forefront of modern mathematics research are topics like artificial intelligence, cryptography, and quantum computing. These cutting-edge fields are pushing the boundaries of what we understand about the universe and the capabilities of our technology. They are also driving major advancements in fields like medicine, finance, and national security.

Despite its vital role in our society, mathematics can still be a daunting subject for many people. But with the right tools and resources, anyone can develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for this fascinating field. Whether you are a student, a professional, or simply someone who is curious about the world around",1
"In recent years, the educational system of Finland has gained a reputation for being one of the most successful in Europe. With a strong emphasis on equity, quality, and innovation, the Finnish model has become a benchmark for countries looking to revamp their own educational systems.

One of the key features of the Finnish system is its focus on universal education. Education is free and compulsory for all children between the ages of 7 and 16, with a strong emphasis on early childhood education and care. This means that children have access to high-quality education from an early age, setting them up for success in the long run.

Another important aspect of the Finnish system is its highly qualified teachers. All teachers in Finland must have a master's degree, and entry into teaching programs is highly competitive. This ensures that only the best and brightest are given the responsibility of educating the country's children.

The curriculum in Finland is also highly innovative, with a focus on project-based learning and interdisciplinary studies. Students are encouraged to explore their own interests and are given a high degree of autonomy, which fosters creativity and critical thinking skills.

Finally, the Finnish system places a strong emphasis on equality. This means that all students are given access to the same high-quality education, regardless of their background or socio-economic status. This is achieved through a range of measures, including free school meals, targeted support for students who are struggling, and a focus on inclusive education practices.

Overall, the Finnish model of education has proven to be highly successful, with the country consistently ranking among the top performers in international assessments such as the PISA tests. Its focus on equity, quality, and innovation provides a blueprint for other countries looking to improve their own educational systems.",1
"Touchscreen publishing company Onswipe has good news for Samsung. As Onswipe's Chief Marketing Officer Jason Baptiste put it in an email, ""Samsung clearly won Christmas when it comes to tablets.""

Specifically, the company looked at visitors to Onswipe-optimized sites for the period of Dec. 26-29 in comparison to Dec. 19-22, as a way to measure the growth that different tablet platforms saw over Christmas. The results? Samsung's Galaxy tablets grew 50.4 percent, Nexus 7 tablets grew 33.8 percent, iPads grew 20.4 percent, and Kindle Fires grew 19.5 percent.

Now, the fact that Onswipe focused on percentage growth is an important caveat here. After all, Samsung was presumably starting from (much) less, so it didn't need to sell as many tablets to see significant growth.

It's also interesting to see the line about Samsung's victory coming from Baptiste, who recently wrote a blog post telling people to ""stop believing the fairy tales about the iPad's demise."" I asked him if the data made him reconsider the post, and he said no: ""Though they enjoyed more growth post holidays, Samsung is still very tiny compared to the iPad and the same goes for the rest of Android. What will be interesting is seeing whether people still use Android tablets 90 days out from now.""

Baptiste also provided some numbers about usage. He said the average session time from Samsung users was three minutes and nine seconds after Christmas, down from 3:32 before. On iPad, the average session was 4:03, compared to 4:12 before. And the Kindle Fire had the longest session time on average, 4:51.

As for how many people this data represents, Baptiste said Onswipe (which recently upgraded its platform) reaches 31 million unique visitors each month on the mobile web.",0

No matter who it was—in that brief moment she had been unable to clearly make out the other person's appearance—it was definitely one of the human cultivators that had entered the Garden of Zhou. This was enough of a reason. It was enough for Xu Yourong who was flying around Sunset Valley to unsparingly use up her true essence once more to adjust her direction and fly over to that heavily injured and unconscious human cultivator's side. At that critical point where it seemed like she would dash herself to death against the ground, she grabbed the cultivator and flew off into the distance.

She had no experience in flying with wings, but she had a lot of experience riding the white crane as it soared through the blue sky. As she soared through the night sky, she had none of that imagined unease or terror. But she was just a beginner after all, so it was hard to avoid some improficiency and awkwardness. This was especially the case when considering that she was already heavily wounded and very weak, and that she was now carrying an extra person. It was hard to avoid swaying a bit, giving the appearance that she was drunk.

It was not too long before Nanke had caught up, only several li behind. Separated by such a distance, she could even feel the killing intent coming from her. She did not turn around, instead focused on learning how to fly. Her wings of fire began to sway less, her posture grew more stable, and her speed began to quicken. Gradually she began to turn into a streak of fire blazing through the night sky.

After the awakening of the phoenix soul, she had comprehended many principles, and gained use of much of her innate ability. Solely in terms of speed, she was without a doubt the fastest on the continent. Whether it was the Red Falcons used by the Great Zhou army or the Great Western Continent's Heavenly Messenger Birds, whether it was Nanke or the swift Silver Dragons; none of them could surpass her speed.

The problem was that she was severely wounded. An even larger problem was that she was currently carrying a person. The person was unconscious, and weighed her down like a wet bag of flour. If she dropped this person, even Nanke would find it very hard to catch up to her. She could go back to the gardens where the rest of the human cultivators had congregated and develop a counterattack against the demon plot. She could also temporarily escape, treat her wounds and the poison in her body, then return to battle Nanke, and this time she believed she would definitely obtain victory.

But she could not do so, so there was no 'if'.

This entire time, she had not glanced at the person in her hands—she made no distinction of identity, because no matter what, she could not throw them away. It was just like Nanke had said at the peak of Sunset Valley. From beginning to end, she was an existence burdened with the word 'responsibility'. Many choices had already become a sort of instinct for her. She did not need to ponder them or weigh the pros and cons, she only needed to carry them out.

Two streams of light skimmed over the forests and wetland at the edge of the plain, their colors only slightly different. Wherever they passed, bits of grass were sent flying and leaves were shocked into puffs of green.

She had never been able to pull away from Nanke and her vision was starting to go fuzzy. This was a sign that the peacock's poison was beginning to erode her sea of consciousness. She had always been using the Heavenly Phoenix's true blood to suppress it, but over the course of this chase, that blood was gradually being boiled away and was no longer able to suppress the poison. Perhaps she could ignite all the Heavenly Phoenix true blood to go even faster, but then what would she do about the poison?

Nanke's figure grew closer and closer and the darkness of the surrounding plain was newly dyed with green. There was no time to think, but in truth, she didn't even think before she made her decision. At this moment, she finally lowered her head to glance at the person in her hands. She helplessly thought to herself, everyone here cultivates the Dao, paying attention to dining with the pure wind and eating the starlight, but just what are you eating every day that you're so heavy?

Then she ignited the meager remnants of the true blood of the Heavenly Phoenix in her body.

With a boom, the surrounding plains began to burn, and glimmers of light from water could be vaguely seen under the grass.

Xu Yourong turned into a streak of fire, and disappeared into the sky.

After a while, Nanke arrived",0
"BREAKING NEWS: Car Accident Leaves Three Injured

In a tragic turn of events, a car accident on Elm Street has left three people injured. The accident occurred at approximately 3:30 p.m. on Monday, when a silver sedan collided with a red pickup truck at the intersection of Elm and Maple Street.

According to eyewitnesses, the silver sedan was traveling south on Elm Street when it ran a red light and struck the pickup truck, which was heading west on Maple Street. The impact of the collision caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a rest in the middle of the intersection.

Emergency services were immediately called to the scene, and all three individuals involved in the accident were transported to the local hospital for treatment. The drivers of both vehicles were identified as 28-year-old Jason Smith and 35-year-old Sam Jones, respectively. The passenger in the silver sedan was identified as 24-year-old Emily White.

The extent of their injuries is currently unknown, but witnesses report that they appeared to be conscious and responsive when they were taken away by paramedics.

The intersection of Elm and Maple Street was closed for several hours as police investigated the accident and cleared the scene. The cause of the accident is still under investigation, but it is believed that the driver of the silver sedan may have been distracted or speeding at the time of the collision.

This tragic accident serves as a reminder of the importance of safe driving practices and the need for all drivers to be vigilant and aware of their surroundings while on the road. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those involved in the accident and their families during this difficult time.",1
"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Hundreds of people are expected Sunday at a wedding expo in Salt Lake City aimed at connecting same-sex couples with businesses who won't refuse to work on gay weddings.

A denial is a common occurrence in a state where florists, bakers and photographers have a legal right to refuse to serve a gay couple.

The Human Rights Campaign says Utah is one of 29 states where it is legal for businesses to refuse services to same-sex couples. A proposal to change that law died last week in Utah's Republican-controlled legislation.

Michael Aaron, the show organizer and publisher of the QSalt Lake magazine, says about 40 LGBT-friendly businesses will be at the expo.

Aaron says the Salt Lake City expo will be the first since same-sex marriage became legal in Utah in 2013.

"We have made ourselves a navel-gazing folk, a little like Americans of the 19th century — until we lunged into the world by bravely going after the crumbling Spanish empire. And in truth there is plenty that is worthy of our inward gaze now that unjust foreign wars have dropped out of the repertoire.

But absorption in our many domestic ills is not what we are all about these days. Vigorous scrutiny at home, never an American habit, is not why we do not much look outward. For most of us, the point is to avert our eyes as our claim to leadership in global affairs weakens. As an impatient world wings past in pursuit of a new order, America is befuddled and America flinches.

This is my read of foreign policy in the era of Obama and John Kerry, our most mediocre secretary of state since Condi Rice. Well, since Colin Powell. No, since Madeleine Albright. OK, since Warren Christopher. Let's say since Larry Eagleburger, since ... Alas, there is a reason the State Department is called ""Foggy Bottom.""

It's time to notice that Kerry cannot do much more than run to catch up. In Syria, in Iran, in the Pacific: State has been managing no more than frenetic improvisation since Kerry took office last February. And when Kerry is able to exert American preferences, as in Egypt, he gets it very wrong — invoking the past, ignoring the new century's extraordinary dynamism, reverting to Cold War typology as if it can still be made to apply (and as if it ever did).

Scraping away the pretense, we are the ones crumbling now — not altogether unlike the Spanish when Teddy Roosevelt set America's sights on them. And I think it is terrific.

This is neither cynicism nor declinism nor simple pessimism. I call it ""the optimism of pessimism."" Once we finish our crumbling — and it is exactly like the Spanish in this regard — we will have a chance of getting on in the world constructively, of taking our proper place in history (as opposed to standing, somehow, above it).

It is a long-wave thought, true — ""the work of a generation,"" to borrow from the honorable Edward Snowden. But this is what makes 2013 so singular a passage in the running tale of U.S. policy abroad. It is hard to see your moment in history — by definition you are in it. But, rare enough, it is easier now than it usually is.

Among Kerry inheritances when he took the chair after Hillary Clinton was the ""pivot to Asia."" The phrase faded quickly, and it was never more than a trumped-up effort to give American diplomacy the appearance of design — ""architecture,"" as the dips like to say. Instantly, Kerry was up to his neck in the quicksands of the Middle East.

Egypt came first. It was hard to detect, not least because of the disgraceful news reporting (or maybe it was the editing), but we witnessed a Washington-sanctioned coup last summer while scarcely noticing it. The instrument was Susan Rice, just then made national security adviser: She put the call through to Cairo, giving the generals the nod.

Mohammed Morsi's fate was exactly the same as Mossadegh's in Iran, 1953 (elected leader, the nation's first, traded for a murderous autocrat) and Arbenz in Guatemala a year later (first elected leader out, military men and 30 years of civil war in). The three had the same flaw by Washington's reckoning: Two social democrats and a moderate Muslim, they all stood outside the arc of American control.

So much for Kerry's dexterity and imagination, as we read about these virtues in the newspapers. The take-home here: We have changed not at all over the past 60 years, and public deception is consistently essential to the proceedings.

We (well, some of us) mourn parts of our past, not least the coups. Bill Clinton, on a half-day visit to Guatemala City during his presidency, actually apologized for the CIA job on Arbenz. In the same way, some of us may someday get around to regretting what we did to the first president Egyptians chose for themselves. But this has to wait until it no longer matters.

And now you see what I mean, perhaps, when I suggest that it is time to recognize that we inhabit our own history.

Next to the same-old in Egypt, Syria and Iran are even more telling of our time. In both cases, we can discern the future arriving.

We are all trained to find Assad repellent. He is, but I would say less so than Pinochet was, to choose one among Washington's many repellent clients over the years. Washington gives not a hoot about Assad's domestic doings. Assad is",0
"Mathematics: A Fundamental Pillar of Science and Technology

Mathematics, the universal language of science, technology, and finance, has been an integral part of human culture for centuries. This discipline of numbers, quantities, and shapes plays a crucial role in almost all aspects of our daily lives and has revolutionized the way we see the world.

From ancient civilizations to modern times, mathematics has been the foundation of innovative discoveries and technological advancements. The field of mathematics encompasses many subfields, including algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics, and topology, each with its unique concepts and applications.

One of the most significant contributions of mathematics has been the development of calculus, a branch that involves the study of rates of change and continuous change. This field has enabled the advancement of science and engineering by providing tools to model and analyze complex systems, such as the motion of planets or the behavior of fluids.

Another area where mathematics has had a profound impact is in cryptography, the science of secret communication. Cryptography is essential in maintaining the security and confidentiality of digital information, from internet banking to military communication.

Mathematics has also played a crucial role in shaping the modern world of finance. The field of finance relies heavily on mathematical models, from calculating interest rates to predicting stock prices. The ability to analyze data and make predictions accurately has been the key to success in the financial markets.

Moreover, mathematics is an essential tool for solving real-world problems, from determining the most efficient way to allocate resources to designing complex transportation systems. Without mathematics, many of the technological advancements we have today would not be possible.

In conclusion, mathematics is an integral part of our lives and plays a fundamental role in science, technology, and finance. With its vast array of subfields and applications, mathematics provides a language for understanding and solving complex problems. Its contribution to human progress is immeasurable, and it continues to shape our world today.",1

"Possible newspaper article:

Two cars collided at a busy intersection on Thursday afternoon, causing injuries and traffic delays. According to witnesses, a sedan was heading east on Main Street when a pickup truck turned left from Oak Avenue, cutting across the sedan's path.

The impact spun the sedan around and caused it to hit a traffic signal pole, while the pickup truck ended up on the sidewalk. Both drivers were conscious but trapped inside their vehicles, and bystanders rushed to help them while calling 911.

""I heard a loud bang and saw smoke coming out of the cars,"" said John Smith, a local resident who was walking his dog. ""I ran over to see if anyone needed help. The sedan driver was bleeding from his forehead and complaining about his back. The pickup truck driver seemed dazed and confused.""

Emergency responders arrived within minutes and assessed the situation. They used hydraulic tools to remove the car doors and extricate the drivers, who were then transported to the hospital by ambulance. The sedan driver, identified as 45-year-old David Lee, suffered a broken leg and several cuts and bruises, while the pickup truck driver, identified as 28-year-old Samantha Jones, had a concussion and a possible concussion.

""I hope they're okay,"" said Sarah Johnson, who witnessed the accident from her office window. ""It's scary to think how quickly things can change. One minute you're driving, and the next minute you're in a wreck.""

The intersection was closed for several hours while investigators gathered evidence and tow trucks cleared the damaged vehicles. The police department issued a statement reminding drivers to obey traffic signals and yield to oncoming vehicles when turning.

""We urge everyone to be cautious and attentive while driving, especially in busy areas like this,"" said Sergeant James Brown. ""Accidents can happen in the blink of an eye, and they can have serious consequences for everyone involved.""",1
"Johnny Herbert – 1986 Quest SF86 Formula Ford 2000

While some of his Formula One seats have left a bit to be desired, Johnny Herbert tells Adam Cooper about his FF2000 nightmare

Now the longest serving driver in Grand Prix racing, Johnny Herbert made his debut in Brazil in March 1989 — some three months before current Sauber team-mate Jean Alesi appeared on the scene. Winner of two Grands Prix for Benetton in 1995, Johnny has established a reputation as a solid, dependable driver who gets the job done. But it's easy to forget that when he first hit the limelight he was regarded as one of the greatest natural talents to come along in years, a young man who seemed destined for World Championship success.

Herbert's early career was mercurial, and it all seemed to come so easy to him. A huge star in karts, he won the Formula Ford Festival in 1985, the British F3 title in 1987, and was a leading light in the 1988 FIA F3000 series until his horrific leg-breaking shunt at Brands Hatch. Despite that massive setback, he was in F1 with Benetton in 1989.

You may have noticed that one year is missing from the above precis of his CV. In 1986 Johnny drove in the British FF2000 series, moving up with same Quest team with which he'd starred in FF1600. Far from repeating the success of the previous year, he struggled through a season which almost sent him tumbling into obscurity...

At the time FF2000 was the crucial 'slicks 'n wings' link between the nursery slopes of FF1600 and the sophistication of F3. Ayrton Senna had contested the British series as recently as 1982, while Damon Hill had made his first, unsteady steps in fourwheeled racing in the category at the end of '83. It was the obvious route for 'golden boy' Johnny to take, and he was joined by fellow FF1600 graduates Mark Blundell and Bertrand Gachot.

The car of choice was the Reynard, which had been dominant for several seasons, and even the crack works Van Diemen and Swift teams struggled to beat the Bicester cars. The Maidstone-based Quest outfit, run by Mike Thompson, had been something of a valiant underdog in FF1600, and neat suspension tweaks had given Johnny the chance to shine. Everyone thought the pattern could be repeated in the quicker 2-litre category. However, Johnny's success had enabled tiny Quest to sell a lot of customer FF1600 cars, and his new FF2000 machine was put together almost as an afterthought.

""I thought it would be a good step,"" he recalls, ""but I didn't know if it was going to be the right one. The car had a two-inch spacer between the engine and the gearbox, and the rest of it was exactly the same as the FF1600. Eventually they made another chassis where the tubing clown the side was a bit thicker. Of course it had never been in the wind tunnel... And it was an aerodynamic brick! When I first got the car we had a Raft F3 wing on the back, and the front may have been off a Ralt as well. We tried a lot of really ugly endplates, but it just didn't have any aerodynamics.

""During testing at Brands Hatch we were three seconds off the pace. I told Mike Thompson and the mechanics to go to Dingle Dell, and I'd go round that corner at a speed that I thought it should be possible to take it in an FF2000. I came charging up, down into third gear, turned in about 20mph faster than I'd ever been before, and I went on the grass, boom, boom, boom from one side of the track to the other. All the wheels were hanging off. The guys were all laying on the bank laughing...""

The team became so desperate that it even tried running a rear wing Johnny brought from home.

""Before I raced FF1600, Sisley Karting had moved in to a new workshop. We went up there, searching around and clearing it up. It had been used by a team called Scorpion, and in the rubbish we found this old rear wing. It was a horrible, mustardy yellow colour. Even at that time it was about 10 years old! I thought I'd take it home and have it on my wall. Anyway, a few years later I bent it back so it was a bit straighter, and we actually tested it on the Quest...""

As the season turned into a classic battle between Blundell and Gachot, Johnny was left trailing, only rarely getting anywhere near the points. He didn't even make the top ten in the British championship.

""I used to race with a guy called Jo Lindstrom, who was in the Argo. The Argo was basically just as bad as the Quest was, so",0

"In the following video, Dr. Jim Willie joins the Plane of Truth to explain more of the details of where we as a society find ourselves with respect to the collapse of the U.S. Dollar. If you've listened to Dr. Willie in the past, you've heard him talk about ""The Voice,"" an individual Dr. Willie has on the inside (by inside I am referring to a ""gold market insider""), and who has thus far remained unnamed. Nonetheless, this insider has proven correct with virtually every prediction he has made so far.

NOTE: It brings up visions of the ""Smoking Man"" in the X-Files doesn't it?

Dr. Jim Willie: The Global ""Banksters"" Plan For the Economic Markets (Video)

Jim Willie: Global Banking Cabal and Their Satanic Rules Are Ready to Strike

Much of the focus of the interview below is on the efforts currently underway by Russia and China as the two leaders of the BRICS Nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) to completely remove the US Dollar from the world stage. As you know, with Dr. Willie there are always plenty of extra surprises included in his interviews, so I'll save those for you to learn on your own!

After the interview, is a recent article by Mac Slavo at SHTFplan.com Slavo Mac quotes Michael Snyder of The Economic Collapse Blog who says we are in the ""early chapters of a total meltdown."" Sadly, that fits what Peter Schiff has been telling us for some time, that the Collapse of the U.S. Dollar Will Be the Single Biggest Event In Human History. It's time to begin making preparations if you haven't already folks…

Mac Slavo at SHTFplan.com writes:

At this point, despite major highs in U.S. stock markets and reassurances from no less than President of the United States himself that the economy is sound, one only need to look around to understand that we are on the cusp of what researcher and collapse strategist Michael Snyder of The Economic Collapse Blog calls the ""early chapters of a total meltdown."" In his latest interview with Future Money Trends Snyder notes that the fundamental economic problems we face can be seen across the globe. The United States, Europe, Asia, and South America are all crashing and no one will be immune to what comes next. It's not sustainable… There's going to be a permanent, massive adjustment and a loss of faith in the current system… as it unravels and implodes we're going to see economic pain on a scale that is historic, like we've never seen before… when this thing finally blows it's going to bring the existing system down.

Full Interview via Future Money Trends:

(Watch at Youtube)

While most Americans think that near-record breaking stock markets are a sign of recovery and revival in the U.S. economy, Snyder goes on to warn that what we've seen in Greece, Cyprus, and Argentina, and what's happening right now in Venezuela, is a coming reality to Americans.

That could mean everything from bank holidays wherein governments authorize the seizure of account holders' deposits, to a full-on collapse scenario like Venezuela where food, toilet paper and basic necessities become totally unavailable.

Michael Snyder explains that the one asset class to protect and preserve wealth in the midst of crisis is precious metals and well known billionaire investors have been rapidly acquiring everything they can their hands on in recent months. And as we've seen just this year, when panic is the order of the day capital shifts into gold and silver as a crisis hedge.

But that's not all you can do to prepare for the next wave, says Snyder, and diversifying your approach to collapse-proofing your life will be critical because we simply don't know exactly how events will play out over coming months and years:

There're are different strategies that are required to get through a period of crisis, even if it's just a recession, but especially if it escalates to a full-blown historic financial crisis.

For example. if people have money in financial markets they may want to evaluate what their risk is… because if things start crashing are they going to be able to survive if their investments crash to a 40% or 50% decline… can you weather that? Can you survive that?

A lot of people are moving into gold and silver as a way to insulate themselves, to protect their wealth during a time of crisis.

Of course, not everyone's in the markets. One thing I really recommend to people is to have an emergency fund in the case you lose your job or there's a business reversal… you just look back at 2008 and all of a sudden there was a huge downturn and millions of people lost their jobs…

From Jared Kushner's meetings with media industry ""deal-makers"" to the launch of a nightly Facebook Live broadcast, signs continue to point to the eventual launch of Trump TV. Now there's the revelation that the Trump Organization already owns three key URLs that could point to a future in the media business: TrumpTelevision.com, TrumpNetwork.com, and TheTrumpNetwork.com.

The latter two addresses once hosted content for a multilevel marketing company that sold vitamins and licensed Trump's name to help dupe people into joining. TrumpTelevision.com, on the other hand, appears to have never hosted anything, according to Yahoo. The Trump Organization has owned these sites since at least December 2012, but they've taken on a new relevance in light of Trump's rumored television ambitions. There's a chance that the Trump Organization is just sitting on these websites so no one else uses them, like it's doing with TrumpVodkaSucks.com and NoMoreTrump.com. But there's also a chance they will soon be home to a TV network that, as Trump might say, is so good ""your head will spin.""",0
"Generative AI: The Future of Innovation

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been making waves in the tech industry for years, with applications ranging from machine learning to natural language processing. But the latest development in AI is generative AI, a technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we create and interact with digital content.

Generative AI is a form of deep learning that involves training algorithms to generate new content, such as images, music, and even entire websites, based on existing data. By analyzing patterns in large datasets, generative AI algorithms can learn to create original content that resembles the data they were trained on.

The implications of generative AI are vast and far-reaching. For one, it has the potential to greatly accelerate the pace of innovation by automating the creative process. With generative AI, artists and designers can quickly generate multiple variations of their work, allowing them to explore new ideas and iterate more rapidly.

Generative AI can also be used to create personalized content for individual users, such as personalized music playlists or news articles tailored to their interests. This has the potential to greatly enhance the user experience and improve engagement with digital content.

However, generative AI also poses some challenges and ethical concerns. For example, the technology could be used to create realistic fake images and videos, which could be used to spread misinformation or defame individuals. As the technology continues to evolve, it will be important to establish ethical guidelines and regulations to ensure that it is used responsibly.

Despite these challenges, generative AI represents a major step forward in AI technology and has the potential to transform a wide range of industries. As we continue to explore the capabilities of generative AI, we can expect to see new and innovative applications emerge in the years to come.",1

"Generative AI: A New Frontier in Artificial Intelligence

As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance, the field of generative AI is attracting significant attention. Generative AI refers to machine learning algorithms that are capable of creating new and original data, such as images, music, and text. This technology has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries, from entertainment to healthcare.

Generative AI works by analyzing large amounts of data to identify patterns and then using those patterns to create new data that resembles the original. For example, a generative AI algorithm trained on images of flowers could create new, unique images of flowers that don't exist in the real world.

One of the most promising applications of generative AI is in the field of medicine. Researchers are exploring the use of generative algorithms to develop new drugs by creating virtual molecules that have the potential to treat diseases more effectively than existing drugs. This approach could speed up the drug development process and make it more efficient.

Another area where generative AI is making an impact is in the entertainment industry. Music producers are using generative algorithms to create new songs and sounds, while video game developers are using them to generate lifelike environments and characters. This technology could also be used to create personalized content for consumers based on their preferences.

However, there are also concerns about the potential misuse of generative AI. For example, it could be used to create fake news or manipulate images and videos in harmful ways. As with any emerging technology, it's important to consider the ethical implications and to ensure that it's used for the greater good.

Despite these concerns, the potential benefits of generative AI cannot be ignored. As this technology continues to develop and improve, we can expect to see it being used in a wide range of applications that could transform the way we live and work.",1
"Machine Learning: The Technology That's Transforming Our World

In recent years, machine learning has emerged as one of the most exciting and promising technologies of our time. From self-driving cars to medical diagnosis, machine learning is being used across a wide range of industries to solve complex problems and make our lives easier.

So what exactly is machine learning? Simply put, it's a type of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. This means that machines can be trained to recognize patterns, classify data, and make decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

One of the key benefits of machine learning is its ability to handle large amounts of data quickly and accurately. This has led to significant advances in fields like healthcare, where machine learning is being used to improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes. Researchers are also using machine learning to analyze large amounts of genetic data to identify new drug targets and develop personalized medicine.

Another area where machine learning is having a big impact is in the field of transportation. Self-driving cars, for example, use machine learning algorithms to process data from cameras, sensors, and other sources in real-time to make decisions about how to drive safely and efficiently. This has the potential to radically transform the way we travel and reduce accidents caused by human error.

Of course, machine learning isn't without its challenges. One of the biggest concerns is the potential for bias in the algorithms used to train machines. For example, if a machine learning algorithm is trained on data that is biased in some way, such as data that over-represents one group or excludes another, the machine may make decisions that perpetuate that bias. This is an issue that researchers are actively working to address.

Despite these challenges, the potential for machine learning to transform our world is huge. As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative applications in fields like finance, education, and entertainment. Whether it's helping doctors make more accurate diagnoses or improving the efficiency of our transportation systems, machine learning is poised to play a major role in shaping our future.",1

"8 reasons to dump that cheating doctor (Trenberth et al are wrong in the WSJ)

Hand back your science degrees Trenberth et al.

Thirty eight of the worlds top, most consequential climate scientists sought to slap down the Nobel prize winner, astronaut and glitterati of science, and all they could come up with was a logical fallacy and a single paragraph of incohate, innumerate, and improbable evidence. It's hand-waving on stilts.

Is that the best they can do?

Trenberth and co try to rebut No Need to Panic About Global Warming, but those 16 eminent scientists quoted evidence and pointed out major flaws in the assumptions of the theory. They described forms of scientific malpractice, and called for open debate. In comparison, the 38 climate ""scientists"" offered hardly more than argument from authority, ""Trust Us: We're Experts"" they said as if the lesser beings, who were mere Professors of Astrophysics, Meteorology, and Physics, were too stupid to know the difference between a doctor and a dentist. I mean, sure the 16 skeptics could be wrong, but if the evidence is so overwhelming, why can't the 38 experts find it?

Q: What kind of doctor is a scientist who can't reason?

A witchdoctor.

First — the Fallacy

1. ""Do you consult your dentist about your heart condition?""

If my dentist tells me that my heart surgeon was caught emailing other surgeons about how to use tricks to hide declines, that he broke laws of reason, that his predictions are basically all wrong, or that his model of understanding is demonstrably wrong, then I'm listening to the dentist.

Try this out: My dentist has no vested interest, but has provided years of trusted service and medical training — and he warns me there are doubts about my heart surgeon and I need to get a second opinion (say from a Dr Lindzen, Dr Christie, or Dr Spencer*). So I tell him to ""go jump"", ""what would he know"", and keep returning to the same heart surgeon even though my blood pressure doesn't change and the pills cost $3 billion a month. Sure.

Eight reasons to dump your doctor:

1. His predictions fail.

2. He uses fallacies to reason — like ""argument from authority"" instead of empirical evidence.

3. He's been caught cheating ""hiding declines"", trying to get dissenting doctors banned from publishing their work, and worrying what will happen if his patients realize how little he knows: ""They'll kill me probably.""

4. He refuses to debate his radical treatments publicly. ""It's beyond debate"".

5. He calls people names — ""denier""

6. He doesn't appear to understand the scientific method – when data disagrees with his theory, he throws out the data and keeps the theory.

7. When you ask him for evidence that the treatment works he keeps saying ""Trust me, I'm an expert"".

8. The numbers don't add up. Where's the cost-benefit sums? (Like this or this?) His treatment plan means the nation needs to lower it's quality of life now, … so … our children's children will live ten minutes longer in 2100?

Second – the hand waving attempt at evidence

1. ""long term warming has not abated"". Since when? With no timeframe this is meaningless. The world has not warmed significantly in a decade. It started warming long before our CO2 emissions ramped up. The world was warmer 1000 years ago, and for most of the last 8,000 years. (See this graph from this page).

2. ""In fact, it was the warmest decade on record"". Our records are woefully short (120 years) and badly disorganized, the original raw records are lost, 89% of the current stations are thermometers near air conditioners or car parks, or near tarmac. See point 1.

3. ""Observations show unequivocally that our planet is getting hotter"". Correlation is not causation. Another logical error. Where is the cause and effect link? It's been warming since 1680, but Napoleon didn't drive to Moscow in an SUV.

4. ""And computer models have recently shown that during periods when there is a smaller increase of surface temperatures, warming is occurring elsewhere in the climate system, typically in the deep ocean."" Marvel at out how CO2 the atmospheric gas traps heat in the deep ocean.


5. ""Such periods are a relatively common climate phenomenon, are consistent with our physical understanding of how the climate system works, and certainly do not invalidate our understanding of human-induced warming or the models used to simulate that warming."" Blah blah blah. Spot the evidence. Translated this says: Sometimes we see things that fit with our view,",0

"The Finnish Education System: A Model for Success

Finland is consistently ranked as having one of the best education systems in the world. The country's approach to education has been praised for its focus on equity, teacher professionalism, and innovative teaching practices. In this article, we will explore the key features of the Finnish education system and what other countries can learn from it.

Firstly, Finland places a strong emphasis on equity in education. This means that regardless of a student's background or socio-economic status, they have access to the same quality of education. There are no private schools in Finland, and all schools are publicly funded. Additionally, schools in different regions are provided with equal resources and funding, ensuring that no school is left behind.

Another important facet of the Finnish education system is the professionalism of teachers. Teachers in Finland must have a master's degree, and the teaching profession is highly respected. This has led to a culture of continuous professional development, where teachers are encouraged to constantly improve their skills and knowledge. Teachers are given a high degree of autonomy in their classrooms, which fosters a sense of accountability and responsibility for their students' success.

Finally, Finland is known for its innovative teaching practices. Rather than relying on standardized testing and rote memorization, Finnish schools prioritize project-based learning, where students take on real-world problems and work collaboratively to find solutions. This approach not only helps students develop critical thinking skills, but also fosters creativity and independent thinking.

Overall, the Finnish education system is a model of success that other countries can learn from. By prioritizing equity, teacher professionalism, and innovative teaching practices, Finland has created a system that consistently produces top-performing students. As the world continues to grapple with education reform, Finland serves as an excellent example of what can be achieved.",1

"6 Red States That Are Turning Green at a Rapid Clip — Are Marijuana Reforms Around the Corner?

Following President Obama's recent comments acknowledging that cannabis is less dangerous than alcohol, Washington Post columnist and sometime Republican strategist Ed Rogers called on the GOP to take a hard stance against liberalizing pot laws.


""Republicans need to be clear,"" he wrote in his January 20 commentary. ""Marijuana use doesn't lead to anything helpful or productive. The president won't say so, but Republican leaders should.""


Not if they're shopping for votes. Recently released statewide polls indicate that marijuana law reform remains a winning issue among voters – and not just voters in stereotypically 'blue' states. Here's a look at various red states that are rapidly turning ""green.""


Arizona


Arizona remains the only state in America where first-time marijuana possession offenses are classified as felonies, punishable by up to two years in prison. And while a majority of state lawmakers remain unwilling to embrace marijuana law reform (the state has the sixteenth highest per capita rate of pot possession arrests in the nation), their constituents are more than ready to do so. Fifty-six percent of Arizonans support legalizing pot for adults, according to polling data released in May. (A separate Public Policy Poll from last January reported even higher support, finding that 59 percent of Grand Canyon State voters would vote 'yes' on an initiative to regulate the weed like alcohol.) At least one state Representative is listening. Democrat lawmaker Ruben Gallego is backing legislation this session to legalize the production and retail sale of the plant. The measure faces an uphill battle. In 2012, Republican Gov. Jan Brewer filed a lawsuit to try and halt the implementation of the state's 2010 voter-approved medical marijuana law. (A federal court ultimately rejected Brewer's request.)


Georgia


Nearly 33,000 Georgians were arrested in 2010 for possessing marijuana – a figure that was the sixth highest in the nation. But according to a just-published statewide Public Policy Poll, a majority of Peach State voters would prefer to see that total be reduced to zero. According to the January PPP poll, 54 percent of Georgians support ""changing state law to regulate and tax marijuana similarly to alcohol."" Fifty-seven percent of those Georgians surveyed support making cannabis legal for medical purposes. And 62 percent of voters support amending state law to make possession offenses a civil violation punishable by a fine up to $100, but without jail time. (Under present law, the possession of any amount of cannabis is classified as a criminal misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.) Following the poll's release, some state lawmakers have expressed interest in forming a study committee to explore various options to allow for the herb's medical use, including allowing for the options of high CBD, low THC strains of the plant.


Indiana


Fifty-two percent of Hoosiers believe that cannabis ""should be regulated like alcohol,"" according to statewide polling data released in December by Ball State University. A slightly greater percentage of Indiana voters, 54 percent, support replacing the state's existing criminal penalties for marijuana possession offenses with civil fines. It's understandable why most Hoosiers support such changes in law. In Indiana, first-time pot possession is classified as a criminal misdemeanor punishable by up to one-year in jail and a $5,000 fine. In 2010, the FBI reported that police made nearly 13,000 arrests for minor marijuana possession violations. Democrat-sponsored legislation to decriminalize the possession of up to two ounces of pot by is presently pending before Senate lawmakers. However, Republican Gov. Mike Pence has spoken out against reforming the state's cannabis penalties, calling the plant a ""gateway drug.""


Louisiana


Few southern states treat pot offenses more harshly than does Louisiana. But while state lawmakers may publically back strict penalties for weed, their constituents do not. Fifty-three percent of voters believe that cannabis ought to be legalized, taxed, and regulated, according to Public Policy Polling data released last fall. Fifty-six percent of voters support decriminalizing the plant and 65 percent support legalizing its medical use. Nonetheless, last year, Senate lawmakers defeated legislation that sought to amend the penalties for repeat marijuana possession offenders. (Under present law, second-time marijuana offenders face up to five years imprisonment and a $2,000 fine. Subsequent offenders face up to 20 years in prison!) Democrats have reintroduced legislation again this year to address the state's odious pot possession penalties. According to state Department of Corrections officials, 1,372 Louisianians are serving sentences for minor marijuana possession. The average sentence is 8.4 years, with 10 people serving life sentences.


Oklahoma


Oklahoma's marijuana penalties are among the most severe in America. Under state law, first-time marijuana possession offenses are punishable by up to one-year incarceration and subsequent offenses are punishable by up to ten years in prison. Selling marijuana is punishable by up to life in",0
"Generative AI: The Future of Creativity

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in various fields, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. However, one area that is gaining increasing attention is generative AI, which has the potential to revolutionize the creative industry.

Generative AI refers to the use of algorithms and machine learning techniques to create original content, such as music, art, and literature. This technology has already been applied in various ways, such as generating music for video games, creating art pieces, and even writing news articles.

One of the most significant advantages of generative AI is its potential to democratize creativity. Traditionally, producing creative content required a certain level of talent, training, and resources. With generative AI, anyone can become a creator, regardless of their background or experience. This opens up opportunities for people who would not otherwise have access to the creative industry, such as those from marginalized communities.

Moreover, generative AI can enhance and complement human creativity. By analyzing vast amounts of data and patterns, AI can generate new ideas and insights that humans may not have considered. This can lead to more innovative and diverse creations and help artists and designers break out of creative ruts.

"How to Top The Initiative Order (Almost) Every Time
When I first started this blog I asked the question ""Who takes Improved Initiative?"" I'm quoting the Gamers II, but it's a legitimate question. Many players are so concerned with having the highest strength, the deadliest weapon, or the most destructive spells that they forget one of the first rules of combat; the guy who throws the first punch is often the one who wins the fight. Stop for a moment, and think about all of the times that going after the bad guy turned a challenging battle into an uphill slog through mud and blood. Sometimes it's a single spell, a single alchemical item, or a single sneak attack that can set the tone for a battle and completely change the tone of a fight. If the bad guy goes first it's a fireball, a color spray, a thunderstone, or any of a dozen other nasty surprises that can tilt a fight in the opponent's favor. The same rules apply to the party. Catching the villain flat-footed is a field day for rogues, spellcasters and gunslingers are more likely to hit, and it provides a peachy opportunity to move around as you please while the enemy can't take attacks of opportunity. Now that I've belabored the point about why Initiative is so important though, it's time for a laundry list for making your score the best it can be. Traits
First man to go is often the last man standing. Your initiative score starts with your dexterity modifier, but that doesn't mean that a low dex will doom you to always go last. Taking the right traits can give you a +2 straight out of the gate. While there are at least 4 traits that provide an initiative bonus, you can only use one of them; there's no trait stacking for a bigger bump. These traits are: - Reactionary (Combat): You grew up bullied and constantly fighting: +2 initiative. - Warrior of Old (Racial, Elf): You've been practicing war for more than some creatures' lifetimes: +2 initiative. - Outlander (Rise of the Rune Lords, Exile Option): You were cast out of your homeland, and have been keeping one eye on your back trail ever since: +2 initiative. - On Guard (Quadira, Gateway to the East): You are always ready. +1 initiative, and if you can act during the surprise round you may draw a weapon as a free action. In addition to these traits, elves have an alternate racial trait they can take called Fleet-Footed. This takes away Keen Senses and Weapon Familiarity, but these elves gain Run as a feat, in addition to a racial +2 to initiative. Handy. The Ifrit has a racial alternative that can help out as well. Wildfire Heart provides a +4 racial bonus to initiative, but it strips away the natural fire resistance that Ifrit receive. Tough choice. Feats There are not a lot of feats that deal with a character's Initiative, unfortunately. If there were then there would be a lot of players who always went first, regardless of what the rest of the party rolled. However, there are at least two feats those concerned with their standings in the initiative order should keep in mind.
Really, do you take black over white? - Improved Initiative: The most common feat for those who want to go first, this feat gives the character a +4 bonus to all initiative checks (Core Rulebook 127). - Noble Scion: Your character is a member of a proud, noble family. If you select Scion of War then you may use your charisma modifier instead of your dexterity modifier to determine your initiative (The Inner Sea World Guide 288). Class Abilities This is where the numbers start to really perk up for characters looking to go before anyone else. A number of classes provide initiative bonuses at fairly early levels, and that should be taken into consideration.
I'd do something quick, before it takes a deep breath. Gunslinger Well-known for being fast on the draw, gunslingers get a +2 to their initiative at level 3, as long as they have at least 1 point of grit remaining. Just to add insult to injury, if the gunslinger in question also has Quick Draw and empty hands then the character may draw a weapon as part of the initiative check. Just picture how fast that is. A particularly feared type of gunslinger is the Grand Marshal (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Paths of Prestige). These law enforcement officers gain a number of abilities, but at second level they gain Danger Sense. Grand Marshals always act during the surprise round, and gain 1/2 their level as an initiative bonus. Inquisitor No one knows the value of striking the first blow like the inquisitor. At second level these fanatics gain Cunning Initiative, adding their wisdom modifiers as a bonus to their initiatives. Additionally, with the feat Grant Initiative (Ultimate Magic 151) an Inquisitor may choose to transfer this bonus to an ally before initiative",0
"Washington D.C. – In the midst of a tumultuous political climate, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are grappling with some of the most pressing issues facing the country today.

With the upcoming midterm elections just around the corner, politicians from both sides of the aisle are vying for control of Congress. This year's elections are shaping up to be some of the most closely watched in recent memory, with pundits predicting a possible shift in power in both the House and the Senate.

At the heart of the political debate",1
"Genocide according to The American Heritage Dictionary is defined as ""The deliberate destruction of an entire race or nation. The Holocaust conducted by the Nazis in Germany and the Rwandan genocide are examples of attempts at genocide.""


An upcoming report from the ""U.S. Holocaust Museum"" will clearly define the actions of ISIS against the Yezidi and other minorities as genocide. Which, according to several reports, will be followed by the Obama admiration designating the actions of ISIS as genocide, in a few weeks.


Should the United States declare the actions of ISIS genocide, then it requires the application of the UN convention against genocide, adopted in 1948. Unfortunately the UN convention is not specific on what that action should be. According to the convention:


""Article I: The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish""


This convention describes what genocide is and who may be punished, from heads of state to private individuals. It does not however give any indication as to the extent the world powers may go to prevent or how to punish. This was evident in the past as actions in Bosnia, Rwanda and Darfur were defined as genocide and some of the perpetrators were caught and punished, long after the fact.


With the exception of Darfur actions has been after the fact and even in Darfur the combined UN/African Union mission is too small to effectively protect civilians. Additionally while the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Bashir it is unlikely to ever be served.


There is no doubt that what ISIS is doing is genocide, they have admitted it, in the case of the Yezidi that they intend to destroy the people and the culture. The questions now are, why it has it taken the world so long to come to this conclusion and what do they intend to do.


Now more than one year after the start of ISIS attacks into Iraq and the genocidal slaughter of the Yezidi, Christian, and Muslims who disagree, the US is prepared to declare it genocide. Then what? While the US did declare what happened in Darfur genocide a declassified State Department memo advised then Secretary of State Colin Powel that making ""a determination that genocide has occurred in Darfur would have no immediate legal--as opposed to moral, political or policy--consequences for the United States."" The determination was however the first time a US official had called an ongoing conflict genocide.


The administration is going to study the report for a few weeks before making a determination. The problem is that by doing so the White House and the State Department are concerned that by declaring ISIS is committing genocide what will this do to the US commitment to Iraq from a military standpoint. Unlike Darfur the United States has a political stake and military forces on the ground.


By failing to declare genocide and committing all available resources to the fight the US and the rest of the world is condoning the actions of one of the most barbaric organization that has infected the world in a long time. The preamble to the UN resolution, formally known as ""The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide"" states ""in order to liberate mankind from such an odious scourge, international co-operation is required."" International co-operation cannot happen if each county is more concerned over internal politics or ideology then about the moral correctness of position.


The Kurdish Peshmerga with the help of the US and anti-ISIS international coalition have just liberated the town of Shingal which will protect the Yezidis and allow them to return to their homes, but it will not eliminate ISIS. To do so will require a full out assault by multi-national forces who will not give up until all vestiges of ISIS are gone. Until that time the scourge of genocide will continue to haunt mankind and the failure of all nations to rid us of it will render all conventions and treaty's calling for its end as meaningless pieces of paper.

"Moscow (AFP) – Russia's defence ministry on Friday announced it has finished evacuating rebels and their family members from Syria's Aleppo, with only ""radical and intransigent"" militants left inside.

"WASHINGTON D.C. - The political world has been abuzz with the latest developments from the office of Senator Jane Smith. The prominent politician, who has been serving in the Senate for more than a decade, has announced her candidacy for the presidency in the upcoming election.

Senator Smith's announcement has been met with both excitement and skepticism. Many of her supporters are thrilled at the prospect of seeing her become the first female president in United States history. Her impressive track record in the Senate, where she has championed causes such as healthcare reform and women's rights, has earned her a loyal following.

However, some critics have expressed doubts about her ability to win the presidency. Some have questioned her lack of executive experience, pointing out that she has never held a governorship or a high-ranking position in the federal government. Others have criticized her for being too closely aligned with the Democratic establishment, suggesting that she may not be able to appeal to voters in the middle of the political spectrum.

Despite these concerns, Senator Smith seems undeterred. In a recent interview with the New York Times, she emphasized her commitment to fighting for the working class and enacting policies that will benefit everyday Americans. ""I believe that this country is at a crossroads,"" she said. ""We need bold leadership that is willing to take on the tough issues and bring people together.""

Senator Smith's announcement has energized the Democratic base and set the stage for a spirited primary season. She will face tough competition from other prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris. However, many believe that her experience and track record give her a strong advantage in the race.

As the presidential election draws closer, all eyes will be on Senator Smith and her fellow candidates as they work to win the hearts and minds of American voters. Whether or not she ultimately succeeds in her bid for the presidency, there is no doubt that she will continue to be a prominent voice in American politics for years to come.",1
"The education system in Finland is widely regarded as one of the best in the world, with its innovative approach to teaching and learning leading to outstanding results.

At the heart of the Finnish education system is the principle that every child should have equal access to high-quality education, regardless of their background or socio-economic status. This is reflected in the fact that Finnish schools are free for all students, from primary level up to university, and that there are no tuition fees for higher education.

Another key feature of Finnish education is that it is highly decentralized, with schools and teachers given a great deal of autonomy to design their own curricula and teaching methods. This allows for a much more personalized approach to learning, with teachers able to adapt their teaching to suit the needs and interests of individual students.

In addition, the Finnish education system places a strong emphasis on the importance of play and outdoor activities, with regular breaks and recesses built into the school day to allow children to move and play outside. This not only helps to promote physical health and well-being, but also allows children to develop social skills and creativity in a relaxed and enjoyable setting.

Overall, the Finnish education system demonstrates that a focus on equality, autonomy, and play can lead to outstanding educational outcomes for all students. It is a model that other countries around the world would do well to learn from and emulate.",1
"An Alberta school funded fully by taxpayers and answerable to a public board requires teachers to abstain from ""homosexual relations"" and warns students that the unjust risk everlasting torment in the ""lake of fire.""

An opposition critic expressed shock Sunday that the Conservative government recently committed to spending $7 million to modernize and expand Prairie Christian Academy (PCA), despite the fact the Three Hills facility displays policies on its website that ""fly in the face"" of both the province's human rights legislation and the country's Constitution.

""Fifteen years after the Supreme Court outlawed discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, it is unbelievable this is still happening,"" Liberal MLA Kent Hehr said.

""I am starting to question what oversight Minister Jeff Johnson and his education department are providing to the system.""

A private religious school founded more than seven decades ago, Prairie Christian Academy joined the Golden Hills School Division in 2003, a decision the school's website says allowed it to get increased public funding.

While parents still pay nominal fees for religious education, the regular program of study, busing and even lease and utility costs are fully covered by the local board.

The K-12 school, located about 130 kilometres northeast of Calgary, is one of several dozen faith-based facilities that have become part of the public system since the province amended the School Act in 1988 to make the moves possible.

A concluding paragraph in PCA's statement of faith, which all students in Grades 7 through 12 are required to sign, says the unjust will go to Hell and be subject to ""everlasting punishment of conscious torment in the lake of fire.""

The reference from the Book of Revelation entered popular political parlance in Alberta during the 2012 provincial election.

Wildrose leader Danielle Smith faced heavy criticism at the time when she refused to dump candidate Allen Hunsperger for his use of the term in a blog post critical of new policies at some school boards aimed at protecting gay and lesbian students from bullying.

The handbook children at PCA receive threatens suspension or expulsion for serious violations of school rules or a display of attitudes which hinder the growth of other students.

""Actions such as social dancing, the use of tobacco, alcohol and non-prescribed drugs are not acceptable,"" the discipline section states.

""The same could be said about the use of pornography and participation in elicit (sic) sexual conduct.""

PCA Professional and Ethical Standards

The school's professional and ethical standards require all teachers to ""uphold the sanctity of marriage, defined as that between a man and a woman, and abstain from homosexual relations and sexual relations outside the bonds of marriage.""

Golden Hills' superintendent Bevan Daverne said he was not aware of any student or staff member at PCA who has been disciplined for sexual misconduct in his three years at the helm.

But Daverne said some special requirements were appropriate for staff in alternative programs.

""If we were offering a language school with French or Spanish immersion, we wouldn't be hiring teachers who weren't fluent,"" he said.

""The same is true with our religious-based programming where we're looking for staff who have a fluency within that faith.""",0
"A Look Back at GODZILLA's 2004 Theatrical Release

Author: Steve Ryfle with Bruce Goldstein

Pressbook Editor: Bruce Goldstein

The following production notes were created by Rialto Pictures for their 2004 theatrical release of GODZILLA. The text is © 2004 Rialto Pictures and © 1998 ECW Press. Godzilla ®, Gojira ® and the character design are trademarks of Toho Co. Ltd. All rights reserved.

50th Anniversary Release! The Complete, Uncut Original! 40 Minutes of Unseen Footage!

GODZILLA

Rialto Pictures Presents the Landmark Monster Movie in Its Original Japanese Version, Never Before Released in the U.S.

Uncut, uncensored, and undubbed, the original ""Monster of Mass Destruction"" returns to the big screen like you've never seen him before, fully restored with 40 minutes of unseen footage and completely revised subtitles. See where it all began, with this influential classic that has spawned scores of sequels and imitations, but has never been bettered.

On a sunny day and calm waters, a Japanese steamer sinks in flames when the sea erupts; a salvage vessel sent to the rescue disappears the same way; exhausted, incoherent survivors babble of a monster. Could it be…? GODZILLA was one the biggest budgeted films in Japanese history at that time, costing more than twice as much as the average Japanese movie. An enormous hit, it spawned 50 years of sequels, countless rip-offs, and a new genre: the kaiju eiga, or Japanese monster movie. Sold to an American distributor a year later, it was re-cut, re-arranged, dubbed, and re-titled GODZILLA KING OF THE MONSTERS with added scenes (shot in Hollywood) of a pre-PERRY MASON Raymond Burr observing the action from the sidelines.

The original Japanese GODZILLA is one of the great films by a sci-fi master, Ishiro Honda (Akira Kurosawa's close friend and occasional second unit director). The U.S. cut ran 20 minutes shorter, with another 20 snipped to make room for Burr, so that nearly a third (about 40 minutes) was shorn. The unrelentingly grim American version excised all of the film's comic relief (including some astonishing, Strangelove-like black humor) and censored its strong anti-H-Bomb message, turning it into a run-of-the-mill, monster-on-the-loose picture.

In Japan, the original, un-bastardized GODZILLA is regarded as one of the great classics of the cinema. In 1984, the prestigious film journal Kinema Junpo rated it among the top 20 Japanese films of all time. In 1989, a survey of 370 Japanese movie critics, Nihon Eiga Besuto 150 (Best 150 Japanese Films), ranked Godzilla the 27th greatest Japanese feature ever made.

The real (human) star of the movie is Takashi Shimura (best known for his Kurosawa roles, including the leader of THE SEVEN SAMURAI and the doomed man of IKIRU), as a revered paleontologist who insists that Godzilla must be studied, not destroyed (he's in the minority). This first Godzilla is truly terrifying — a 30-story Jurassic behemoth intent on destroying an exquisitely detailed miniature Tokyo — a tour de force by special effects genius Eiji Tsubaraya. Tsubaraya's use of ""suitmation"" — the often-belittled ""actor in monster suit"" method — was due to time and budget restraints, but, in concert with noirish cinematography, his low-tech approach is still as thrilling as ever. This print also features new subtitles by Bruce Goldstein and Michie Yamakawa.

"Scientists Discover New Method for Detecting Cancer Early

Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery towards detecting cancer at an earlier stage than ever before. A new method of detection, called liquid biopsy, has been found to be effective in detecting tiny fragments of cancerous DNA in a person's blood.

The new test, which is non-invasive, could revolutionize the way cancer is detected and treated, as it allows doctors to detect cancer before it spreads.

Liquid biopsy is a blood test that looks for tiny fragments of DNA that are shed by cancer cells into the bloodstream. These fragments can then be analyzed to determine if a person has cancer.

This new method is much less invasive than traditional cancer screening methods, such as biopsies or scans, which often require surgery or radiation.

Not only is liquid biopsy less invasive, it is also more accurate. In a recent study, liquid biopsy was found to be 100% accurate in detecting ovarian cancer. This is a huge breakthrough, as ovarian cancer is often difficult",1

New court documents have revealed how prosecutors protected friends of Prince Andrew's paedophile's pal to avoid them being brought to court over child sex abuse charges.

Investigators suspected billionaire Jeffrey Epstein abused 34 underage girls but lawyers failed to charge him or any of his ""co-conspirators"" and instead offered him a secret plea bargain.

In court papers that were previously sealed it has been revealed how prosecutors said they would keep from the judge Epstein's friends who have been accused of being involved in the abuse.

The documents were released as part of the ongoing civil case brought by two alleged victims of Epstein against US federal prosecutors' handling of the financier's conviction.

Lawyers for the women claim the plea deal granting Epstein and any potential co-conspirators immunity from further prosecution violated their clients' rights.

In September 2007, Assistant US Attorney Marie Villafana sent an email to Epstein's lawyer Jay Lefkowitz suggesting prosecutors attempted to keep information about his alleged crimes from judges.

It read: ""I will include our standard language regarding resolving all criminal liability and I will mention 'co-conspirators', but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge.""

The new paperwork fuels suspicions Epstein's legal team and US prosecutors colluded to ensure the powerful billionaire did not face the most serious charges.

In another email Villafana tells Lefkowitz: ""I wanted to tell you that I have compiled a list of 34 confirmed minors.

""There are six others, whose name we already have, who need to be interviewed by the FBI to confirm whether they were 17 or 18 at the time of their activity with Mr. Epstein.""

Epstein later pleaded guilty to two state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution, serving 13 months after being sentenced in 2008.

Also within the newly released cache Epstein's lawyers demanded letters to victims informing them their cases were not being pursued were not issued.

Earlier this year one of Epstein's alleged victims accused Prince Andrew and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell of being involved in the abuse.

Virginia Roberts, who claimed she was the American's sex slave, claimed in courts papers the Duke of York had sex with her in London, New York and on Epstein's private Caribbean island when she was 17 years of age.

The claims were vehemently denied by Buckingham Palace and were removed from US civil court records following a federal judge's ruling in April.

Court papers lodged in Florida accused Andrew of abusing Miss Roberts when she was 17.

Her accusations were part of submissions made by lawyers acting for the now 31-year-old who wanted to join the existing civil lawsuit launched by the two other women.

US District Judge Kenneth Marra refused Roberts permission to join the claim, and said in his written judgement the sex abuse details had no bearing on the lawsuit's goal of reopening the Epstein non-prosecution agreement.

"I know Greg Taylor. He is not exactly a *** artist but does have many ways to avoid being seen in the public eye because anonymity is the safest way to make sure he doesn't get caught if he messes up. He does try to complete jobs from time to time but often takes people's money without having done any preparation to do the work or knowing what the materials costs. It will take a much longer time than promised to get the results, if you get any. He does use women, or other people if he can to hide himself and will try to open bank accounts,loans and businesses in other people's names. Whether or not he is a sociopath, I don't know. Whether or not your work will get done is uncertain. He has different names and many businesses he hides behind.

As for romance goes, he uses women for their information. He uses love as an excuse to get them to do what he wants. He uses his older children as bait to seem stable to attract them. He has six kids. Two of them he is not allowed to see and another is a baby with a 23 year old woman. I can only imagine the stories the mothers have to tell.

He tries to do his job as a contractor most of the time. He may or may not use your money to get your job finished. He may be using your money to get himself out of a jam with another job.

There are many men like him who will do the same thing, trying to complete jobs and finish things up. He does want a good career path but his inability to be honest and realistic with his sales has destroyed what career he could have had. He has many successful friends but he himself has failed to make the correct decisions in business and thus, anyone who puts their money in his hands is at the mercy of a man who does not know how to use it wisely.",0

Xconomy, a national site dedicated to covering stories on life sciences, advanced manufacturing, health IT, energy, consumer tech and water technology, launched a Wisconsin hub this week.

""I am especially pleased with our Wisconsin launch because it came together so fast. We've met with a tremendous reception, both in Madison, the state capital, and Milwaukee, the largest city,"" said Xconomy CEO Robert Buderi.

""In both places, we've not only been welcomed incredibly warmly, we've found an unusual spirit of collaboration, and many, many stories of innovation that we can't wait to start telling …""

Founded in 2007, Xconomy is a news and events company committed to hyper-local coverage of the high-technology sector. Xconomy's current network includes Boston, Boulder/Denver, Detroit, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Texas and Wisconsin.

""As editor of Xconomy's new Wisconsin bureau, I plan to dive deep into the state's innovation economy, shining a spotlight on the interesting stories that deserve to be told,"" said Xconomy Wisconsin editor Jeff Engel.

""I will also examine the weaknesses holding the region back from being mentioned in the same breath as America's foremost innovation hubs.""

Engel, a former reporter for Milwaukee's Business Journal, will split this time between Milwaukee and Madison.

The site features articles, a calendar of events and lists a number of underwriters who are key players in innovation and technology in Wisconsin.

""We thank each of these organizations and everyone else who has helped give us this opportunity to tell the story of the Wisconsin innovation community, Buderi said.

"The European country of Finland has gained international recognition for its innovative and successful educational system. With a focus on equity and excellence, Finland has consistently ranked among the top performing countries in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA).

One of the key features of Finland's educational system is the emphasis on equal opportunities and access to education for all students. The country provides free education for all students, including preschool, primary, secondary, and vocational education. Additionally, students with special needs are provided with individualized support and resources to ensure their success.

Finland's educational system also places a strong emphasis on teacher training and development. All teachers are required to hold a master's degree in education and undergo regular professional development. Teachers are trusted as professionals, allowed to design their own curriculums and given the autonomy to make decisions about their classrooms.

Another unique aspect of Finland's system is the lack of standardized testing. Instead, teachers are given the responsibility of assessing their students' progress and providing feedback. This approach is believed to reduce stress and competition among students, while encouraging creativity and collaboration.

One of the most notable aspects of Finland's system is the focus on play-based learning. In the early years of education, children are encouraged to learn through play, exploration and discovery. This approach is believed to foster a love of learning and develop critical thinking skills.

While Finland's educational system is not without its challenges, such as a lack of diversity and the need for continued innovation, it remains a model for other countries to follow. Its focus on equity, teacher training, play-based learning, and individualized support for students has proved to be a successful formula for producing well-educated and well-rounded citizens.",1
"Premier Kathleen Wynne was coy Wednesday when asked by CBC News if she was planning on proroguing the legislature, which the opposition believes could be a way to avoid accountability.

The house is scheduled to sit until June 9 before taking a summer break, resuming Sept. 12, but the majority Liberal government has already passed most of its agenda this session, including enabling legislation for the partial sale of Hydro One, its sexual violence and harassment action plan and changes to electoral boundaries.

There are still two major pieces of legislation — the budget bill and cap-and-trade legislation — that have not yet passed, but are expected to in the near future.

CBC reporter Mike Crawley asked if she was planning on proroguing once those bills get through the legislature.

""There is a lot more work to do in the province, so stay tuned for how we're going to continue to build this province up,"" she replied.

Government House Leader Yasir Naqvi also did not deny that the government is considering prorogation.

""We've got a lot of work ahead of us,"" he said. ""We have a very ambitious legislative agenda. We have some significant bills in front of us and our focus is right now to pass those bills.""

Opposition questions motives

The opposition parties suggested the Liberal government might want to prorogue to avoid question period.

""They're mired in waste, mismanagement and scandal and I think that's the real reason this government wants to run, but it won't be able to hide from the people of Ontario,"" said Progressive Conservative Vic Fedeli.

The government has been on the receiving end of criticism in question period for its partial sale and privatization of Hydro One, and more recently changes in the budget to seniors' drug costs that the opposition says will leave most seniors in the province paying more. Wynne has said she will reconsider the changes.

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the government ""has been everything but transparent and open,"" such as ignoring the public outcry to the sale of Hydro One and feedback on budget consultations.

""They are simply deciding that they don't have to account to anyone,"" she said. ""This is the place of accounting. This is the place where the opposition holds the government to account on what people are saying are problems in this province.""

There is also growing speculation Wynne will shuffle her cabinet at some point this year, since she has not made any substantive changes since the 2014 election.

Prorogation can be a standard tool for governments, but former prime minister Stephen Harper sparked vigorous debate after he prorogued in late 2008, when his minority government faced the spectre of being unseated by an opposition coalition.

In October 2012, after increasing criticism over the costly decision to cancel the plants, former premier Dalton McGuinty abruptly announced a plan to resign as premier and prorogued the legislature. It was done to allow for a cooling off period after a bitter contempt of parliament debate erupted in the legislature over his energy minister's refusal to produce all documents related to the plants.",0
"A Russian police officer risked his own life to prevent a road accident that put dozens of children in danger. He ran his patrol car into a vehicle, speeding head on into a convoy of children's buses.

The cop miraculously survived the crash.

On Saturday, the officer, now hailed as a hero, Aleksandr Kosolapov, was escorting a convoy of nine buses transporting about 300 children from a summer camp to the city of Abakan, the capital of the Khakassia Republic in sourthern Siberia.

Suddenly, a car driving at high speed in the opposite lane, started coming head on in the convoy's direction.

Kosolapov reacted instantaneously and shielded the children's buses with his own car, a decision that may well have saved hundreds of young lives.

""As a result of the massive collision the patrol car was literally turned into a pile of metal. According to the experts, it's a miracle the police officer is still alive,"" Khakassian police said in a statement.

The car that almost crashed into the children's buses had five people including a 10-year-old child onboard. All of them received minor injuries. As for the kids on the buses, they were safe and sound, thanks to the brave policeman, who was seriously injured himself.

Kosolapov is now conscious and in a stable condition, spokesman for the region's police, Sergey Kuznetsov, reports, adding the officer has already spoken to his colleagues.

Khakassia's police have received a lot of letters, thanking the courageous hero cop. If the doctors allow it, a group of children who were on the buses, will pay a visit to their rescuer, Kuznetsov added.

The authorities have opened a criminal case against the reckless driver, who put the children's lives in danger.",0

"The ongoing war in Ukraine has been a major topic of discussion in the international community for the past few years. The conflict began in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and has since escalated into a full-scale military conflict between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists in the Donbass region.

The war has resulted in thousands of deaths and displacement of civilians, with many towns and cities in the Donbass region being destroyed. The conflict has also led to a deepening of tensions between Russia and Ukraine, with both countries accusing each other of aggression and violation of territorial sovereignty.

Despite several ceasefire agreements and peace talks, the situation in Ukraine remains volatile, with frequent clashes and sporadic violence. The conflict has also had a significant impact on the Ukrainian economy, with the country's GDP shrinking by around 20% since the war began.

The international community has been largely critical of Russia's actions in Ukraine, with many countries imposing economic sanctions on Russia and providing military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has also strained Russia's relations with other countries, with the US and European Union imposing sanctions on Russia for its role in the conflict.

The war in Ukraine continues to be a major challenge for the international community, with no clear path towards a resolution. While some progress has been made through peace talks and diplomatic efforts, the conflict remains a major source of instability and violence in the region.",1

"Justin Meram chuckled for a moment earlier this week, acknowledging how crazy all of this is.

The 28-year-old midfielder is a little more than two months removed from signing a contract extension with Crew SC. With four goals and four assists through 11 games, Meram is a Best XI contender. He also is a focal point of a Crew team looking to re-establish its credibility after a disastrous 2016 season. For all of his recent successes, Meram has been noticeably more critical of himself, a product, he said, of not being satisfied.

""I've been here for seven years, but there's no more of this 'hug it out' and 'you're young and growing,' "" Meram said. ""I'm not stopping, and if I stop, I'm shortchanging myself and this club.""

Meram isn't about to stop, especially given where he has come from. The Justin Meram of 10 years ago had virtually no prospects in soccer. Today's Justin Meram is still a bit bewildered by the path he took to professional soccer.

""I had an interesting, tough, weird journey to get to where I'm at,"" he said.

In summer 2007, Meram was more or less done playing soccer. He graduated from Eisenhower High School in Shelby Township, Michigan, without soccer scholarship offers, and moved with his family to Arizona.

""The local schools in Michigan, the club coaches, the local teams, the (professional development) teams, nobody wanted me,"" Meram said. ""No one thought I had talent.""

But he missed soccer, and that was enough for him to join his brothers for a men's league game at a park in Scottsdale, just hours after arriving in Phoenix. Wearing basketball shorts and Kelme turf shoes, he played well enough to catch the eye of Maurice Hughes.

Hughes, it turns out, was a Phoenix native who was home after a stint with the minor-league Atlanta Silverbacks. He also was a two-time national champion at Yavapai College, a community college in Prescott, Arizona.

Hughes was shocked to learn that Meram didn't have a place to play, and he offered to put Meram in touch with Yavapai coach Mike Pantalione.

Meram said his backup plan at the time was to enroll at Arizona State, where he had been in touch with the football team's special-teams coach and planned to walk on as a kicker. The sequence of events — how things fell into place to continue his soccer career — still gives Meram chills.

""What would I be doing with my life if Maurice Hughes wasn't watching a friend, or if my brother (Jason) didn't take Maurice Hughes' number down?"" Meram said. ""He told me about a school called Yavapai. What is Yavapai?""

Hughes said he hadn't spoken to Pantalione in a few years when he phoned the longtime coach on a Sunday afternoon.

""I just told him, 'Hey, this is really random, and I know you probably already have your roster for next year, but I have this kid that I just encountered,'"" Hughes recalled.

Pantalione bought Hughes' endorsement. He bought Meram's ability from the team's first training session of the 2007 season, in which he put his team through six-a-side drills to get everyone a few touches on the ball.

""I remember it vividly. A number of players scored one or two goals in the two-hour session, and Justin had about a dozen,"" Pantalione said.

Yavapai went 50-2 during the 2007 and '08 seasons, winning two national titles. Meram set the school record with 132 points and sits No. 2 on the career goals list with 51. Meram primarily played forward, but every so often — Pantalione estimates about 20 percent of the time — he moved Meram out to the left wing to open things up inside the box.

""I was saying it in a joking fashion, but I said, 'Hey, when you're a pro someday, that's where you're going to play, so get out there,'"" Pantalione said. ""He would kind of just shake his head and eventually wander out there.""

Today, Pantalione laughs when he watches left wing Justin Meram play for Crew SC because he knows which moves are coming. He made clear that Meram's success — just like that of Yavapai alumni Alan Gordon (Colorado Rapids) and Roger Espinoza (Sporting Kansas City) — was the player's creation.

""All we did was open the door for him, and he took full advantage,"" Pantalione said.

As Meram put it: ""From no scholarships to too many.""

He chose Michigan over",0
"While debate rages on over the effects of wireless technology on human health, those who claim a hypersensitivity to electromagnetism have called on B.C. Ferries to provide options to limit their exposure.

Louise Campbell of Nanoose Bay says her sensitivity to wireless devices can make a ferry ride to the Mainland a nightmare.

""For me, my day is thinking about how long I can spend in the mall, because there's Wi-Fi in the mall. If I'm going to a friend's house, I have to ask them to turn the Wi-Fi off,"" she said.

Campbell claims her condition causes her to become lightheaded when exposed to wireless devices.

A two-hour trip into the city can leave her fatigued for the rest of the day. Campbell avoids restaurants, coffee shops, movie theatres and anywhere she expects exposure.

The situation impelled Campbell to call on B.C. Ferries to provide a way to limit exposure to the ship's wireless technology while on voyages to the Mainland.

She is not the first to make the request, said B.C. Ferries spokeswoman Deborah Marshall. Marshall advised people like Campbell to reach out to the customer care department.

""There are some areas on the ship that the signals are quite weak . . . for example, the car decks,"" she said.

The effect of wireless technologies, like Wi-Fi routers and cellphones, on human health has become a contentious topic in recent years. Many in the scientific and medical communities have countered the assault on wireless with stiff resistance. Those who say they suffer call it a disability.

Christel Martin, the Nanaimo representative for Citizens for Safe Technology, said more support is needed for people with the disability.

""There has to be a Wi-Fi-free zone,"" she said. ""We're asking for equal rights, like any disabled person.""

Health Canada maintains that ""there is no convincing scientific evidence that exposure to low-level radiofrequency energy from Wi-Fi causes adverse health effects in humans.""

Nevertheless, the debate will continue in the coming years as public Wi-Fi becomes more common and the world around us grows increasingly wireless.

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control capped off a two-year project in March with the release of its ""radiofrequency toolkit"" for environmental health practitioners.

The 371-page report broke down the myriad types of wireless frequencies used in Canada, the research on their effects and methods to avoid exposure.

""We realize that there will continue to be divergent views on the effects of RF. And we hope that scientists from across Canada can join us in contributing their knowledge and understanding to future integrative work in this enormous field,"" wrote Dr. Tom Kosatsky, the BCCDC's director of environmental health services.

""These are the people who put me where I am today,"" says Jackman, who's been married to Australian actress Deborra-Lee Furness since 1996. ""I love getting out there and meeting the people.""

How nice is Hugh Jackman? Two hours later, the woman sitting next to me on the plane back to the West Coast has a dreamy look in her eye and shows me her iPhone. ""I was buying magazines and ran into Hugh Jackman!"" she gushes. ""He even took a picture with me.""

Hugh Jackman: I think you just know. There isn't a question mark there.

YourTango: What is your best parenting advice? Your daughter Ava is now 8 and son Oscar is 13. What is life like at Chez Jackman?

Hugh Jackman: My best parenting advice is to give you no advice. The only parents who give advice are the ones who are not parents yet. Don't trust the advice. Just do it.

YourTango: Does your wife keep things centered when you're filming?

Hugh Jackman: She's the greatest. I'm one of the lucky ones. She's very wise, a great actress, and a great wife and mother. Did you see her host ""The View?"" She does it all. I'm really proud of her.

YourTango: As a father, how difficult was it to do a movie about a missing child?

Hugh Jackman: It was gut wrenching. I read something from a father ... the most howling part is knowing your child is waiting for you and can't understand why you're not there. The police say, 'Let us do our job.' It's maddening to think you can't do anything and you're failing your child. It's hard to comprehend.

YourTango: On a much lighter note, are you the coolest dad around because you're Wolverine?

Hugh Jackman: My kids are used to seeing me with the long Wolverine hair and hair on my face. I've been playing the role since before my son was born and now he's 13.

"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has been a source of international concern since it began in 2014. The war, which began as a result of the annexation of Crimea by Russia, has claimed the lives of over 13,000 people and displaced millions.

Recently, tensions have escalated once again in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian government has accused Russian-backed separatists of violating a ceasefire agreement and attacking Ukrainian troops. In response, Ukraine has sent additional troops to the region.

The United States and European Union have condemned Russia's actions and expressed support for Ukraine. US President Joe Biden has pledged to support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, calling on Russia to de-escalate the situation.

Russia, on the other hand, has denied any involvement in the conflict and has accused Ukraine of provoking the fighting.

The situation remains tense, with both sides continuing to exchange fire. The conflict has taken a toll on the civilian population, with many living in areas affected by the fighting and struggling to access basic necessities.

The international community has called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, with many urging Russia to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The situation remains fluid, and it is unclear what the future holds for Ukraine and its people.

"On-site verifications last year at GVK Biosciences showed irregularities ""in each and every one of the nine trials inspected,"" the European Medicines Agency said in a May report (AFP Photo/Miguel Medina)

European Union nations have until August 20 to suspend the sale of some 700 generic drugs made in India, the EU's executive confirmed on Monday.

The European Commission took the action after an Indian firm contracted by drug companies to test the medications was found to have manipulated data.

On-site verifications last year at GVK Biosciences showed irregularities ""in each and every one of the nine trials inspected,"" the European Medicines Agency said in a May report recommending the suspension.

The broad scope of the problems, which stretched back years, ""highlights critical deficiencies in the quality system in place at GVK Bio's clinic in Hyderabad,"" the EMA said.

The company tests for ""bio-equivalence,"" to see if the generic versions of drugs are identical in impact to the original.

Commission officials were quick to say that there was no reason to suspect the drugs -- including some brands of common pain relievers such as ibuprofen -- had caused any health problems, or that suspending sales would create shortages.

""There is no evidence of harm or lack of effectiveness,"" a spokesman said.

Removing the medications from shelves ""has been important both for ensuring patient safety and for retaining the confidence in the EU marketing authorisation system,"" he added.

Several European nations -- including France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg -- did not wait for the EU to act, blocking sales in December or earlier this year.

A few of the medications covered by the suspension have already been reauthorized based on data from other inspection centres.

The decision in Brussels was published on July 20, and specified that EU members had one month to comply.

Countries that declare a particular drug to be ""critical"" can take up to 24 months to implement the measure, the Commission said.

Specifically, GVK Bio was found to have manipulated electrocardiograms (ECGs).

""Even if ECGs do not provide the most essential data for testing bio-equivalence, GVK did not respect good practices,"" noted Francois Hebert, deputy head of France's National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety, which carried out the inspections.",0
"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has been a source of concern for the international community for several years now. The conflict began in 2014, when protesters in Ukraine’s capital, Kiev, overthrew the country’s pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych. Russia, which had long been a supporter of Yanukovych, responded by annexing Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula on the Black Sea, and supporting separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.

The war has been marked by frequent ceasefires that have failed to hold, leading to sporadic fighting that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions. The conflict has also led to a diplomatic standoff between Russia and the West, with the United States and European Union imposing economic sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine.

Recently, there have been signs of progress in the peace talks, with both sides agreeing to a new ceasefire in July of this year. However, the ceasefire has been tenuous at best, with both sides accusing the other of violating it. The situation remains tense, and many are concerned that any small incident could trigger a wider conflict.

The war in Ukraine has had a devastating impact on the country’s people and economy. The conflict has led to a humanitarian crisis, with millions of people in need of aid, and has caused significant damage to infrastructure and the economy. Ukraine has struggled to rebuild and recover from the conflict, and many fear that the ongoing instability will continue to hinder progress.

Deft spinners find the words to confuse observers as to the actual sober reality of political decisions, especially ones that have developed an odor. But the real dark talent is to convince unsuspecting voters that what they think is true is actually the opposite.

The election results of 2016 were not a fluke. The American people were not confused and voters have the Clintons figured out. They know the Clintons have dragged the country through the back alley of 1960s excess. The Clintons are far too willing to put the country through the trauma and turbulence that results from their desire to grow their bank accounts in tandem with their political power.

Did Comey deny Hillary Clinton the White House? No. In fact, Clinton broke the law and mishandled classified information, a fact she continually swerves around.

Her top advisor, Huma Abedin, was married to an alleged child predator but she thought it acceptable to inappropriately send State Department information to her husband's laptop which he used for his leering sessions. Comey had already permanently damaged his reputation by publicly flogging Secretary Clinton for her abuse of sensitive information and for her failure to give consistently honest answers to the FBI, without recommending corresponding legal punishments. If anything, Director Comey aided and abetted the Clinton campaign and only went public with his actions when pushed by Congress or in response to the sleaziness of Weinergate.

To be even clearer, there would not have been any FBI investigation if Hillary Clinton had simply followed the law on the custody of her government emails and sensitive government information. What doomed her candidacy was a maniacal desire for personal secrecy and her belief that adherence to government standards were akin to Leona Helmsley's view of paying taxes, they are for ""the little people.""

Did WikiLeaks cost her the election? Once again the answer is no. The release of private emails is abhorrent and WikiLeaks has many victims, but Hillary Clinton is not among them. The leaked emails showed the American voter what they already knew. The DNC under Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz was engaged in an effort to deny Sen. Bernie Sanders a fair shake at the Democratic nomination, scamming the American people, particularly Democratic voters, and compromising the",0
"Washington D.C. - Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent politician and senior United States Senator for Massachusetts, made headlines yet again this week with her latest proposal to reform the American health care system.

In a speech given on the Senate floor, Senator Warren outlined her comprehensive plan to create a federally funded health care program that would offer coverage to all Americans regardless of age, income, or pre-existing conditions. Dubbed ""Medicare for All,"" the proposal aims to expand upon the existing Medicare system and create a single-payer system that would eliminate private health insurance.

Senator Warren's proposal has drawn both praise and criticism from across the political spectrum. Supporters argue that it would provide universal coverage and lower overall healthcare costs, while opponents have raised concerns about the potential tax increases and the impact on private insurance companies.

This is not the first time Senator Warren has taken a bold stance on health care reform. In 2017, she co-sponsored Senator Bernie Sanders' ""Medicare for All"" bill, which failed to pass in the Senate. However, since then, the idea of a single-payer healthcare system has gained increasing support from Democratic lawmakers, with several presidential candidates, including Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, adopting it as a key issue in their campaigns.

Senator Warren's latest proposal is just one example of her commitment to fighting for progressive policies that address issues of inequality and social justice. She has also been a vocal advocate for consumer protection and financial regulation, and has introduced legislation to reduce student loan debt and increase affordable housing.

With a track record of standing up for working families and challenging corporate interests, Senator Warren has become one of the most prominent voices in the progressive movement. Her vision for a more equitable and just society continues to inspire and mobilize millions of Americans across the country.",1

"Trump reportedly mistakes communion plate for offering plate

If you're going to have a momentary misstep while attending a church service, being too quick to make an offering probably isn't a bad one to make.

Such was the case with Donald Trump at a Sunday service at First Christian Orchard Campus in Council Bluffs, Iowa, the Associated Press reports. When communion was passed to Trump, wife Melania, and two staffers in attendance, the GOP front-runner briefly mistook it for the offering plate and grabbed a number of bills from his pocket, according to AP.

""I thought it was for offering,"" he said with a chuckle to his staff, AP reports.

No harm done, though, as Trump later made a donation when the time came a few minutes later in the service.

Evangelicals have long been critical in Iowa's GOP caucuses, and as The Washington Post notes, Trump's efforts to court them haven't always gone swimmingly:

""Trump has made several efforts to woo evangelicals, including a recent visit to Liberty University in Virginia. There he was made fun of after he cited a Bible verse as being from ""Two Corinthians"" instead of ""Second Corinthians."" (Using ""Two Corinthians"" is common in Britain, and his mother is from Scotland.)""

As Trump left Sunday's service, AP notes that the church's pastor offered him a prayer ""that Jesus would guide his decisions.""

""Thank you,"" Trump said. ""I need that.""

"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has been a source of global concern for the past several years. Despite numerous peace talks and ceasefires, the war has continued to rage on, resulting in the loss of countless lives and the displacement of millions of people.

The conflict began in 2014 when Russian-backed separatists seized control of Crimea, a Ukrainian territory. Since then, fighting has escalated in eastern Ukraine, with both sides accusing each other of violating ceasefire agreements and committing war crimes.

The war has taken a heavy toll on the Ukrainian people, with many living in constant fear and uncertainty. The economy has also been severely impacted, with businesses closing and unemployment rates skyrocketing.

The international community has been divided in its response to the conflict, with some countries calling for a diplomatic solution while others have imposed economic sanctions on Russia. The United Nations has also been involved in efforts to negotiate a peaceful resolution, but progress has been slow.

The situation in Ukraine remains volatile, with no clear end in sight. As the war continues to ravage the country, it is important for the international community to work together to find a lasting solution that ensures the safety and wellbeing of the Ukrainian people.",1

Introduction

Wherever you are from, it is probable that you eat tomatoes in one form or another. Tomatoes originated in South America but are now found all over the world. Without tomatoes we would have no cheese and tomato pizza; no ketchup; no baked beans on toast; no lasagne or spaghetti Bolognese; no tomato soup; no BLTs; no mozzarella, tomato, and basil salad; no tomato gazpacho; no tuna nicoise; no salsa; and no tomatoes with our fried breakfast--or any of the other hundreds of dishes that use this savoury fruit. (Although often thought of as a vegetable, tomatoes are technically a fruit. They contain the seeds from which new tomatoes plants will grow.)

Wild Tomatoes

Tomatoes are thought to have first grown in western South America, in the region of modern day Peru and Ecuador. Wild species are still found in these areas as well as farther south in Chile and Bolivia. Tomato plants are found in all sorts of environments from the deserts and dry valleys on the Western slopes of the Andes to fog-saturated cloud forests and even above the snowline on the Andean mountains. However, most wild species prefer dry conditions.

Very varied in size, colour, and appearance, most wild tomatoes don't look anything like those you would buy in a shop. They are usually about a centimetre across, green in colour, and covered with fur. What's more, their taste can be distinctly bitter and unpleasant. Which of these wild tomatoes (if any) gave rise to the modern tomato is not certain, but it probably developed from the species Solanum pimpinellifolium, which looks and tastes most like the tomatoes we are used to.

Domestication of the Tomato

At one decisive moment in the history of the tomato, someone decided to plant and grow tomatoes rather than picking them in the wild. This was the very first tomato farmer and with that move the future of the tomato was changed forever. When or where this first happened we will never know for sure. Some people have guessed tomatoes were first grown in Peru and Ecuador (around where the tomato originated thousands of years ago). This area was home to many complex civilisations, culminating in the Incas, but no evidence has yet been found that any of them farmed tomatoes. Others have suggested that tomatoes were first cultivated by humans in Mexico--around 4000 miles to the north. Certainly by the 1500s, when Europeans first arrived in Mexico, the native peoples had long been growing tomatoes for food.

Wherever it first happened, when people started farming the tomato it would have looked much like it did in the wild. However, each time they picked their tomatoes they could use the seed from the best ones (e.g. the biggest or the sweetest) to sow more tomato plants. By selecting the best tomatoes to grow, they grew plants with better and better tomatoes. This process of changing a wild plant into one that is good for humans is called domestication and it is how wild tomatoes began to change into the tomatoes we eat today.

Spread of the Tomato

Well before the 1500s the tomato plant had already travelled 4000 km north, from its origin in the Andean region of modern day Peru and Ecuador to Mexico. It may have been that tomato plants were deliberately transported north to Mexico by humans or that after eating tomatoes birds or other animals carried the seeds there in their stomachs .

In 1492, Columbus made his first landfall in the New World. This was to change the future of the tomato, as it led to the Spanish exploration and conquest of the Americas, their discovery of the tomato plant, and the eventual spread of the tomato to all four corners of the earth.

The first tomato plants to be taken to Europe probably came from Mexico, the site of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, which was conquered by the Spanish conquistador Cortes in 1519. Here the Spanish discovered the Aztecs eating a domesticated form of the tomato that they referred to as Xitomatl. Bernardino Sahagun, a Franciscan priest who visited Mexico in 1529, wrote that the Aztecs combined tomatoes with chillies and ground squash seeds to make a sauce [or salsa]. Salsa made with tomatoes and chillies is still a popular relish in Mexico and the USA today. To find modern recipes for the tomato, including salsa, click here .

It is likely that tomatoes first arrived in Europe via some Spanish port. However, the first record we have of tomatoes in Europe appears in the 1544 work of an Italian herbalist called Matthioli. The tomato that Matthioli studied was around the size of a fist and a bright yellow colour so he called the tomato ""pomi d' oro"", or ""Golden Apple"". The tomato and the name 'Golden apple' spread quickly north through Europe. Tomatoes were",0

"New Study Shows Significant Progress in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease

Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Despite decades of research, there is still no cure for the disease, but a new study published in the Journal of Neuroscience may offer hope.

The study, conducted by a team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, focused on a specific protein called Tau that accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer's patients and contributes to the development of the disease.

The researchers used a cutting-edge gene-editing technology called CRISPR to create a new mouse model that mimics the human brain's response to Tau accumulation more accurately. They then used the model to test a new drug that targets Tau.

The drug, called MK-8719, was successful in reducing Tau accumulation in the mouse brains and improving cognitive function. The researchers believe that these findings could lead to the development of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease that target Tau.

"Scientists Discover New Species of Marine Life in the Depths of the Pacific Ocean

In a groundbreaking discovery, a team of scientists has announced the discovery of a new species of marine life in the depths of the Pacific Ocean. The discovery was made during a recent expedition led by renowned marine biologist Dr. Jane Smith and her team of researchers.

The new species, which has been named Marispirula pacifica, was discovered at a depth of 3,000 meters using a remotely operated underwater vehicle. The creature is a type of cephalopod, similar to squids and octopuses, but with a unique spiral shape. Its shell, which is made of a hard, crystalline material, is a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other cephalopods.

According to Dr. Smith, the discovery of Marispirula pacifica is particularly significant because it represents a new branch of the evolutionary tree for cephalopods. ""This creature is unlike anything we've seen before,""",1

"To the eternal gratitude of pure football fans, Next Gen Stats lack the capability to provide hot takes on the Week 15 antics that led to Odell Beckham's one-game suspension.

What Next Gen Stats can tell us, though, is that the notion of Josh Norman shutting the Giants' No. 1 receiver down is pure hogwash.

There was no clear victor in this over-hyped matchup.

Beckham caught four of six passes for 30 yards and the game-tying touchdown with Norman in coverage on 22 of Eli Manning's 47 pass plays, per Next Gen Stats.

Those numbers don't begin to tell the full story.

While Norman's superior physicality neutralized Beckham near the line of scrimmage, downfield routes were a different story.

Just over a minute into the game, Beckham beat Norman off the line and broke inside, gaining open space only to drop a potential 52-yard touchdown. Beckham had 2.5 yards of separation on Norman when the perfectly placed ball struck his hands.

A similar scenario played out early in the third quarter when Manning targeted Beckham on a 40-yard throw. Beckham gained 2.08 yards of separation by the time the ball left Manning's hand and a gaping 4.25 yards when the ball hit the ground on a misfire caused by Panthers defensive end Charles Johnson.

Beckham also beat Norman on a 10-yard sideline pass, only to drop a low pass from Manning.

In total, Beckham won enough routes versus Norman to leave roughly 100 yards and a touchdown on the field.

NFL Films senior producer Greg Cosell put it in even starker terms after meticulously reviewing the all-22 film.

""Norman did match up to Beckham, but they didn't play man coverage very often. And in fact, Beckham killed him,"" Cosell said this week on the Fantasy Guru Matchup Podcast. ""I watched every play and I studied it hard because I knew it would be a topic of conversation. Beckham was beaten mentally. ... But physically, it's not even close. Norman can't cover Beckham.""

Norman is a worthy Defensive Player of the Year candidate and should join Patrick Peterson as the first-team All-Pro cornerbacks this season. But he certainly didn't ""shut down"" Odell Beckham in the Panthers' shootout victory.

If anything, Beckham shut himself down for 57 minutes.

Here's what else we learned from Next Gen Stats in Week 15:

1. While that receiver-cornerback clash failed to produce a clear victor, the same cannot be said for the showdown between Steelers wideout Antonio Brown and Broncos corner Chris Harris in their own shootout at Heinz Field. Entering the game, Harris hadn't surrendered a touchdown since Week 12 of the 2013 season. It was realistic for the Broncos to believe the ultra-stingy Harris could hold his own versus Brown, while Aqib Talib concentrated on Martavis Bryant and Courtney Roby trailed Markus Wheaton. That wasn't the case. Harris battled, but Brown still burned him for 147 yards and a pair of touchdowns on 13 receptions and 15 targets in Harris' coverage.

Harris just earned his second straight Pro Bowl nod. He's one of the best in the business. Brown is on another level.

2. Sammy Watkins isn't quite at Brown's level, but he's trending in that direction. Watkins is fourth in receiving yards and third in receiving touchdowns over the past five weeks. Emerging as one of the NFL's most dangerous deep threats, Watkins reached 22.13 mph on his 48-yard bomb -- the second-fastest speed on a touchdown catch this season. The previous week against Philadelphia, Watkins had the fourth-highest speed (21.15 mph) on his first-quarter touchdown. As well as he's playing, it's understandable that he would be calling out underperforming teammates for not putting forth the same effort level.

3. The rebirth of Darren McFadden -- written off as washed-up prior to his age-28 season -- has been a bright spot in an otherwise dark Cowboys season. McFadden covered an efficient 3.27 yards per rushing yard gained versus the Jets, reaching a max speed of 21.27 mph on a 33-yard run. He now owns two of the five highest speeds at the position over the past two weeks. Even though McFadden didn't join the starting lineup until Halloween, Adrian Peterson is the only player in the league with more 100-yard rushing performances this season.

4. Cardinals rookie David Johnson was even more efficient in covering just 2.93 yards per scrimmage yard gained versus the Eagles. Johnson's total distance traveled of 671 yards was the most of any Week 15 running back, resulting in 229 yards from scrimmage. The tackle-breaking 47-yard touchdown run that channeled Marshawn Lynch's ""Beast Mode"" covered more distance (69.48 yards) and reached a higher speed",0
"6 years ago

Greenville, North Carolina (CNN) – At a Labor Day rally, Republican vice presidential hopeful Rep. Paul Ryan raised the question 'are you better off' and compared President Barack Obama to one-term President Jimmy Carter.

""You see the president has no record to run on. In fact, every president since the Great Depression who asked Americans to send them into a second term could say that you are better off today than you were four years ago, except for Jimmy Carter and for President Barack Obama,"" said Ryan.

- Check out the CNN Electoral Map and Calculator and game out your own strategy for November.

The 1980 presidential race was largely defined by that question after Republican Ronald Reagan posed it rhetorically at the end of his only debate with Democratic incumbent Carter.

Republican running mates Mitt Romney and Ryan are hammering that same message after prominent Democratic surrogates couldn't give a definitive ""yes"" to the question in various television appearances over the weekend. On Monday Democrats seemed more certain, though still attempted to balance touting improving economic data with the tough realities that many Americans still face.

The seven-term Wisconsin congressman delivered the GOP's counterattack at a rally before thousands of people at East Carolina University, located nearly 250 miles from Charlotte where the Democratic National Convention is being held.

""In 1980, under Jimmy Carter, 330,000 businesses filed for bankruptcy. Last year, under President Obama's failed leadership, 1.4 million businesses filed for bankruptcy,"" Paul said. ""Take a look at people who are having a hard time making their mortgage payments, 77,000 delinquent mortgages by the time Jimmy Carter left office. Under President Obama 3 million.""

Ryan's campaign later clarified that he was mentioning total bankruptcy filings, not only business filings.

He continued, ""So when you take a look at what we are going to hear in Charlotte today, the president can say a lot of things and he will, but he can't tell you that you are better off. Simply put, the Jimmy Carter years look like the good old days compared to where we are right now.""

Obama's re-election team defended the president's record and said their GOP challenger was ""waxing nostalgic about how things were three decades ago"" with the comparisons to Carter.

""The truth is that under the President's leadership, we've gone from losing 800,000 jobs a month to adding 4.5 million jobs over the last 29 months of private sector job growth,"" Obama campaign spokesman Danny Kanner said in a statement.

Republicans have long sought to portray Obama as unqualified to the challenge of fixing America's ailing economy, and much of last week's Republican National Convention was spent attacking Obama's record on jobs creation.

Romney's campaign said the theme would continue through the week, leading up to Obama's acceptance of the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday.

A new poll indicates Romney has a slight advantage in North Carolina. Obama narrowly won the battleground state four years ago. He was the first Democrat to carry the Tar Heel state in a presidential election since 1976.

""Your country needs your help. Eastern North Carolina is so crucial and important to this,"" Ryan told hundreds in one of two overflow crowds on Monday. ""This election is one of the most defining election of our lifetimes, no matter what generation you come from.""

"Generative AI: The Future of Creativity

Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way we live, work and interact. From self-driving cars to personalized medicine, AI has enhanced our lives in varied ways. One of the most exciting and emerging fields of AI is generative AI, which is transforming the creative industry.

Generative AI is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms to create digital content such as images, videos, music, and even text. These algorithms are designed to learn from large amounts of data, analyze patterns, and generate new content that is similar to the training data.

The potential of generative AI is enormous, and it has already made significant strides in the creative industry. For instance, it has enabled the creation of realistic images of people and objects, which can be used in video games, movies, and advertising. It has also been used to generate music that mimics the style of famous musicians, such as Beethoven and Bach.

Moreover, generative AI is highly versatile and can be used in a broad range of applications. For instance, it can be used to create personalized advertisements for customers, generate captions for images, and even create short stories and poetry.

One of the most significant advantages of generative AI is its ability to create content that is not possible for humans. For instance, it can be used to create new color schemes, patterns, and designs that are truly unique and innovative. This has enormous potential in fields such as fashion, interior design, and art.

However, there are also some concerns about the potential negative impact of generative AI. For instance, there are concerns that it may lead to job loss for creative professionals, and that it may be used to create fake news and propaganda.

Despite these concerns, the potential of generative AI cannot be ignored. It has the potential to revolutionize the creative industry and unleash a new era of creativity and innovation. As such, it is essential that we continue to explore its potential while also addressing its potential negative consequences.",1

Top-down, one-size-fits-all approaches to dealing with these challenges, such as the government's now-abandoned mandatory internet filter, are not appropriate, nor likely to be effective in terms of outcomes or value for money. More nuanced policy approaches that employ proportionate technical responses, combined with empowering individuals, particularly through education, are in most cases likely to be much more successful.

We are therefore pleased that the government appears to now finally accept that its mandatory internet filter policy was such a top-down approach that was unworkable and posed a serious threat to free speech in Australia.

While the government's new plan, for having ISPs block child abuse sites based on an Interpol-maintained list does amount to a form of internet filtering, it is currently of a very limited nature and involves a degree of transparency and accountability in relation to the list of blocked sites.

We continue to believe that filtering based on block lists is a relatively ineffective approach with a number of potential problems, however, this new policy appears to be a workable approach to addressing one aspect of the problem of harmful content.

We encourage policy-makers to undertake meaningful engagement with civil society groups early on in the policy formulation process to ensure that such poorly-designed policies are avoided in future.",0
"Florida is moving fast in its pursuit of Mississippi State athletics director Scott Stricklin to fill the same position in Gainesville.

According to a report from The Clarion-Ledger, Florida made a second offer to Stricklin on Tuesday after he turned down a previous one earlier this month. Reports surfaced earlier Tuesday claiming Stricklin had emerged as the lead candidate for the position.

Current Gators athletic director Jeremy Foley announced in June his plan to step down from the position Oct. 1, though he intends to remain with the school in an emeritus role. The National Association of College Directors of Athletics in March named Stricklin the 2015-2016 Under Armour Athletics Director of the Year.",0
"Reza Baluchi was picked up off Florida in his ""hydropod.""

A Florida man trying to reach Bermuda, Haiti, Cuba and Puerto Rico in a giant inflatable bubble was rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard over the weekend.

Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney said long-distance runner Reza Baluchi was picked up Sunday off Florida and his ""hydropod"" was being towed to shore. Baluchi agreed to be voluntarily rescued.

The Coast Guard tweeted Sunday that Baluchi's voyage had ended ""after he violated a USCG order not to embark on his seagoing journey.""

The contraption, years in the making, includes 36 buoyancy balls on each side, a life jacket with a water filter, a GPS tracking device and even shark repellent.

Man to Travel in 'Ocean Bubble' From South Florida to Puerto Rico

A man has spent three nights sleeping on the beach building an unusual vessel, and it's all for a good cause. NBC 6's Laura Rodriguez has his story. (Published Wednesday, April 13, 2016)

Baluchi set out from Pompano Beach on Saturday, despite receiving an April 15 letter from the Coast Guard warning him not to depart, according to Barney.

The Coast Guard said it had reviewed Baluchi's plan and determined it to be unsafe. The first leg alone was about 1,033 miles.

Baluchi, however, was undeterred.

""Mind is power. It's 85 percent your mind. Anything you can do,"" he said before leaving Florida.

He tried to make a similar journey in 2014 and had to be rescued about 70 nautical miles east of St. Augustine.

Baluchi — an endurance athlete who has biked through six continents and run the perimeter of the United States — has said his eventual goal is to run through every country in the world and raise money for children in need.

"Tuesday night, Scott Rabalais of The Advocate in Baton Rouge set the internet ablaze.

Rabalais reported that there are ""strong indications"" that Les Miles is coaching for his job these next two weeks (at Ole Miss tomorrow and vs. Texas A&M next weekend). As we at FootballScoop know quite well, when you write an article like that, you fairly quickly are told by powers in the know that you are right…or wrong.

Rabalais updated things today with a note along those same lines…noting that he was right (according to ""sources with knowledge of the unfolding situation"").

Rabalais notes that there are three major scenarios in play.

LSU wins out – In which case Les is ""clearly safe""; however Rabalais adds that staff changes could be in the offing. LSU loses out – ""There is little chance Miles would be allowed to return"". LSU splits these two games – Many shades of gray. Poker. This could go in any direction and the gloves might come off.

Miles' buyout is $15 million if he is let go prior to January 1, at which time it drops to $12.9 million. Throw in another $2 million for the assistants (per Rabalais) and perhaps another $5 million to secure the new staff…and oh my this would the riskiest move Joe Alleva has ever recommended in his life. Better be right Joe.",0
"President Donald Trump may be angry at the conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus for its role in thwarting his plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but that doesn't mean the Republicans' constituents feel the same way.

Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida and Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan were both met with warm receptions when they recently returned to their districts during Congress' two-week recess, according to a report by Reuters.

At Amash's town hall meeting in a high school auditorium in Battle Creek, Michigan, 34-year-old Eric Smith told Reuters that ""if I had to choose between Justin and Trump, I'd go with Justin for sure.""

""At this point, I'd give Donald Trump a D,"" Smith said.

72-year-old Cliff Ward told Amash that he supported the conservative congressman's decision to block the American Health Care Act, but added, ""now we need you to work with Trump and the other Republicans to get this done.""

Meanwhile, 84-year-old Melvin Shebester told the wire service that he appreciated his Florida represantive defying Trump because ""it takes a lot of guts to stand up against your party.""

Trump has already made it clear that if the House Freedom Caucus won't play ball with his health care repeal agenda, he will target them politically in future elections. Last month he even wrote on Twitter that ""The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!""",0
"In a breather for Indian IT firms, the ""discriminatory"" USD 2,000 H-1B fee mostly imposed on them has now lapsed in a Republican-majority US Congress.


The charges, often called outsourcing fee, had forced Indian IT companies in the last few years to pay millions of dollars towards protecting the US-Mexican border from illegal immigration.


Indian firms had described the fee on highly-qualified IT professionals coming to the US on a H-1B visa as ""discriminatory.""


The legislation with regard to a USD 2,000 fee on H-1B visas for companies having more than 50 per cent of its employees oversees was adopted by the US Congress in 2010 mainly at the instance of a group of lawmakers led by Senator Charles Schumer.


Passed on August 10, the law contains provision to hike H-1B and L-1 Visa fee per application by USD 2,000 and USD 2,250 respectively for qualifying firm; which mainly targeted Indian IT companies.


The duration of law was extended from four to five years under James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 to provide healthcare and financial compensation for the firefighters and other 'First Responders' who helped out in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack.


In a report released last month, NASSCOM said Indian tech industry contributed an estimated over USD 375 million during this period to the US Treasury including helping America secure its borders.


In a recent interview, NASSCOM president R Chandrashekhar described the fee as unjustified. ""It had nothing to do with the IT industry. It was applied in an inequitable way, which specifically targeted Indian companies,"" he said, adding that he would welcome any move to eliminate the fee.


The Congress can still come up with a legislation to reinstall the discriminatory H-1B fee, which lapsed yesterday night, Congressional sources said.


However, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE-USA) in a statement criticised the US Congress for the lapse of the H-1B fee.",0
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue of Chinese incursions with the visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting last night.

The issue will be further raised by the Indian side today when the two leaders meet for a summit meeting, MEA spokesperson said.

""The summit meetings are occasion for leaders to raise all substantive issues having bearing on bilateral ties, The Prime Minister took the opportunity to raise the issue last night with the visiting dignitary,"" MEA spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said.

The matter will be further discussed when the leaders hold talks in restricted and delegation level.

Modi, who hosted a private dinner for Xi in Ahmedabad after his arrival there yesterday, conveyed India's concern over the Chinese incursions, sources said.

Chinese Army has reportedly made a fresh incursion in Chumar area in Jammu and Kashmir and refused to return. As many as 100 more soldiers of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) arrived from a hillock of Chumar area and strengthened its numbers to nearly 350.

The stand-off in Demchok in Ladakh where Chinese nomads -- Rebos -- had pitched their tents is also continuing. The incursion in this area is nearly 500 metres deep into Indian territory.",0
"Generative AI: Pioneering the Future of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been making significant strides over the past few years, with generative AI being one of the latest technologies that have emerged. Generative AI refers to the use of algorithms and machine learning models to generate new data, images, sounds, and even entire works of art. This technology is revolutionizing the field of AI, and its applications are far-reaching, from music and video production to healthcare and finance.

Generative AI works by training a machine learning algorithm on a large dataset of information, such as images, videos, or text. This algorithm then uses this data to generate new content that is similar to the original dataset but also has its unique characteristics. For example, a generative AI model trained on a collection of paintings can create new artwork that resembles the original pieces but also contains its unique style and flair.

One of the significant advantages of generative AI is its ability to create new content automatically, without any human intervention. This means that it can save an enormous amount of time and effort in various fields, such as music and video production, where artists can use the generated content as a starting point for their work.

However, generative AI also poses several challenges, particularly in terms of ethics and copyright. For instance, if a generative AI model generates artwork that is similar to an existing copyrighted work, who owns the copyright of the new artwork? Should the copyright be attributed to the original artist or the AI model?

Despite these challenges, the potential applications of generative AI are vast, and its impact on various industries is already starting to take shape. For example, in healthcare, generative AI models can help doctors predict the likelihood of a patient developing a particular disease based on their medical history. In finance, generative AI models can be used to predict economic trends and make better investment decisions.

In conclusion, generative AI is a groundbreaking technology that has the potential to revolutionize various industries and change the way we live our lives. As with any emerging technology, there are challenges that need to be addressed, but the potential benefits far outweigh the risks. It is undoubtedly an exciting time to be a part of the AI community, and generative AI is at the forefront of this movement towards a brighter, more automated future.",1
"New Study Shows Promising Results in Cancer Treatment Research

A new study in cancer treatment research has shown promising results in using immunotherapy to treat solid tumors. The study, conducted by researchers at a leading cancer center, utilized a novel approach to targeting cancer cells that may hold the key to more effective and less toxic cancer treatments.

The study focused on a type of immunotherapy called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. This type of therapy involves genetically modifying cells from the immune system to better recognize and attack cancer cells. While CAR T-cell therapy has shown success in treating certain types of blood cancers, its effectiveness in solid tumors has been limited.

However, the researchers in this study used a modified approach to CAR T-cell therapy, which involved targeting a protein called mesothelin that is overexpressed in many solid tumors. By genetically modifying T-cells to recognize and attack cells expressing mesothelin, the researchers were able to significantly reduce tumor growth in animal models.

"Mathematics: The Universal Language

Mathematics is an integral part of our daily lives, whether we realize it or not. From calculating bills and measuring ingredients in cooking to predicting stock market trends and designing complex structures in engineering, mathematics is ubiquitous. It is the language of science and technology and plays a crucial role in shaping the world we live in.

The origins of mathematics can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Babylonians and Egyptians, who used basic arithmetic to keep track of trade and commerce. However, it was the Greeks who laid the foundation for modern mathematics with their development of geometry and the concept of proof.

Since then, mathematics has expanded to encompass a vast array of fields, including algebra, calculus, statistics, and topology, to name a few. These fields have applications in various industries such as finance, medicine, and computer science.

Mathematics isn't just about solving equations and crunching numbers; it's also about problem-solving, critical thinking, and logical reasoning. It teaches us how to approach and analyze complex problems systematically, breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.

Unfortunately, mathematics has gained a reputation for being difficult and inaccessible, leading many to shy away from it. However, this couldn't be further from the truth. Mathematics is a subject that anyone can learn and enjoy with the right mindset and approach.

In recent years, there has been a push to make mathematics more engaging and accessible through the use of technology and real-world applications. For example, math games and puzzles have been developed to make learning math fun and interactive. Additionally, many universities and organizations offer free online courses and resources to help people of all ages and backgrounds learn math.

In a world where technology is rapidly advancing, there is an increasing demand for individuals with strong mathematical skills. From data analysts to software developers, the job market is full of opportunities for those with a solid foundation in mathematics.

In conclusion, mathematics is a fascinating subject that underpins many aspects of our daily lives. It may",1

"BOSTON – Two former corrections officers at the Essex County Correctional Facility were sentenced recently in U.S. District Court in Boston for their involvement with smuggling Suboxone into the Essex County House of Corrections – Middleton for inmates.

Katherine Sullivan, 32, of Londonderry, N.H., was sentenced yesterday by U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs to 36 months of probation, 120 hours of community service, and ordered to pay a fine of $5,000. In November 2016, Sullivan pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring with inmates to distribute Suboxone, a drug used to treat opioid addiction, between October and December 2015.

In January 2017, U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns sentenced John S. Weir, 34, of Danvers, Mass., to the same sentence after Weir pleaded guilty to conspiring with inmates to distribute Suboxone between September and November 2014. Both Sullivan and Weir have resigned from their positions as corrections officers.

The investigations revealed that Weir and Sullivan obtained Suboxone strips from sources outside the jail and smuggled the contraband into the facility when reporting for their shifts. Inmates receiving the Suboxone from Weir and Sullivan then sold the drug to other prisoners inside the correctional facility.

Essex County Sheriff Kevin F. Coppinger said, ""We have a zero tolerance policy for this type of behavior and we will take swift and decisive action in all cases.""

Acting United States Attorney William D. Weinreb; Harold H.

"Police have arrested two men allegedly involved in a double shooting in Chinatown early Saturday morning.

One woman was killed and a man was critically injured.

The shooting took place inside Cuties Cafe at 36 N. King Street just before 2 a.m.

Police said two men attempted to rob the establishment before the shots rang out.

Benjamin Baniaga, who lives nearby, says he was asleep when he heard the loud noises. ""I heard choke commotion really loud, I heard something break then a guy saying 'Hey, let go!'""

Paramedics arrived on scene around 2:30 a.m. and treated 44-year-old Tara Tevaga of Halawa with a gunshot wound to her chest. She was transported to a nearby hospital, where she later died.

Police say a 25-year-old man was also shot in the shoulder. He was taken to the hospital in serious condition and is expected to survive.

Shortly after the shooting, police say they were able to locate and arrest 29-year-old Dane Salanoa for investigation of robbery. He was later released pending investigation,

A second suspect, 30-year-old Alabanza Tuimaleali'ifano, was arrested Saturday night. As of Monday afternoon, he was charged for manslaughter, attempted murder and other firearms charges. His bail is set at $1 million.

Court records show Tuimaleali'ifano was also arrested in May for carrying a replica gun in a public place, but posted bail.

Meanwhile, undercover Honolulu police officers raided Cuties Cafe on Saturday morning, seizing at least 12 illegal gambling machines.

Barry Wagenvoord, who works nearby, says he's seen suspicious activity at the business for some time.

""That café place has been sketchy for a while,"" he said. ""When they first opened up, they specialized with waitresses in lingerie and that seemed to stop for a while.""

Wendy Khoang owns N.K. Wine Shop next door and told Hawaii News Now that fights break out often at the establishment.

The business has blacked out windows and security cameras.

""I always lock my door,"" Khoang said. ""A lot of customers come in and ask why my door is locked during business hours, but I say it's for security purposes I have to do that.""

It's no secret, Chinatown and the Keeaumoku areas are known to house illegal game rooms. Law enforcement agencies have been working to shut them down for decades.

""As long as the customer needs that, there's going to be the existence of these gambling locations,"" says retired FBI agent Hilton Lui, who is now a private investigator. He says he worked many game room raids before retiring in 1993.

Lui says there are actually less now than there were in the mid 1980's, but the way they operate has changed over the years. Lui says instead of a few people owning multiple, large operations, he says, there are a lot of smaller ones now, often run by individuals. He says that makes it harder for law enforcement to devote resources because it isn't often cost effective. ""You need undercover officers,"" he says, ""Then you need to seize the devices and the monies you get.""

""It's not easy getting in there, they have that little security camera,"" says defense attorney David Hayakawa, ""They have to buzz you in."" He says new customers need to be brought in by known players, and undercover officers can have a hard time even getting their foot in the door. Hayakawa says Honolulu police and prosecutors do try, but even after a bust, the operation will often reopen somewhere else shortly after.

""I have always asserted that gambling is connected to dangerous criminal activity, and this shooting is an example of that."" Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney Keith Kaneshiro told Hawaii News Now in a statement.

The Honolulu Police Department also sent us a statement saying they have executed more than a dozen search warrants this year on suspected game rooms.

"Scientists Discover New Way to Combat Climate Change

Scientists from around the world have discovered a new way to combat climate change through the use of innovative technology. The technology, called carbon capture and storage (CCS), is designed to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, which is a major contributor to global warming.

The process works by capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes and power plants, and then storing them in underground sites. This prevents the carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere and contributing to climate change.

The development of CCS technology is a major breakthrough in the fight against climate change. It has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 90%, which could significantly slow the rate of global warming.

The technology is also cost-effective, making it an attractive option for businesses and governments looking to reduce their carbon footprint. In fact, some countries have already implemented CCS technology, including Norway, Canada, and the United States.

This new technology is just one example of the many ways that",1
"The baking bug has bit my sister, Dom, and me. Weekends when she is in town we take the ideas we've been collecting in our time apart and eagerly start cooking little confections that we turn around and feed to the wonderful people in our lives. It feels a little like we're the Stepford Wives when we put the aprons on (I have some adorable ones) but I happen to think it is a ton of fun to just get girly and bake like we mean it.

This weekend had us making Dipped Graham Cracker cookies and Teddy Graham Cupcakes. Both of which were super easy. Since her and I do this mostly for fun we rarely do our recipes from scratch. Eventually we might progress that way but with our time limited we want to make the most of everything and just buy box mixes. Both of these treats took so little time to make and are really easy to personalize.

Supplies for Dipped Graham Cracker Cookies:

1. Graham Crackers

2. Your choice of chocolate (we used milk and dark)

3. Sprinkles or marshmallows

4. Wax paper for drying

Supplies for Teddy Graham Cupcakes:

1. Teddy Graham cookies (we used two different flavors)

2. Cupcake mix (we used a new kind by Betty Crocker called Fun-da-Middles that has icing in the center)

3. Icing for the cupcakes

4. Don't forget backing cups for easy removal once cupcakes are cooked!

Dipped Graham Cracker Cookies

Steps for Dipped Graham Cracker Cookies:

1. Melt your chocolate in a microwave safe bowl. Alternatively you can melt your chocolate in a sauce pan if you are going to be making a lot of these. We heated it up for about a minute until it was nice and runny.

2. Break your graham crackers into smaller sections (or leave large for a bigger cookie) and dip it into the chocolate. Move it around a bit if needed to cover one end of the cracker.

3. Lay dipped pieces onto the wax paper in rows, leaving room between each. After you get a few dipped, go back and add your sprinkles. This will ensure your chocolate doesn't harden before you can add the sprinkles. We also used little marshmallows.

4. To quicken the hardening process we put our cookies on trays and set them in the fridge for ten minutes.

And you're done! So simple and yet it makes a fun snack that isn't too rich. It goes great with some milk too! I recommend that you keep your cookies refrigerated until you want to serve them as it will keep the chocolate from getting soft in room temp.

Teddy Graham Cupcakes

Steps for Teddy Graham Cupcakes:

1. Mix up your cupcake batter per the instructions on the box.

2. If you are using the Betty Crocker Fun-da-Middles mix then fill your baking cups 1/3 of the way full.

3. Knead the icing package about 20 times to soften it, then divide it among the cupcakes. About a tablespoon per cupcake should work. Make sure you put the icing in the middle. Once the icing has been added, cover with the remaining batter. Bake according to time listed on box.

4. Now it's time to decorate! We used whipped icing and covered it with chocolate sprinkles and marshmallows. Finally, add your Teddy Grahams!

With the lighter, whipped icing these yummy confections weren't too rich; just the right amount of sweet!

I am already thinking of ideas we can try for the next time she is in town. These projects have been some of my favorite. It is great way for us to spend time together and grow closer. Dom has the biggest sweet tooth I've seen in a human being and baking with her is just another connection between us. I treasure these moments.",0
"Machine Learning: The Future of Innovation and Job Creation

Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has become a buzzword in the tech industry. It is revolutionizing the way businesses operate, from improving customer service to enhancing product recommendations. This innovative technology has the potential to change the face of our economy and create new job opportunities.

The primary goal of machine learning is to enable computers to learn and adapt to data without being explicitly programmed. This means that machines can learn from vast amounts of data and make predictions, identify patterns, and gain insights to make decisions with accuracy and speed.

One of the most significant advantages of machine learning is its ability to automate mundane tasks, freeing up human employees to focus on more critical work. For example, in the healthcare industry, machine learning algorithms can identify patterns in patient data to create personalized treatment plans and predict patient outcomes.

Another area where machine learning is making significant strides is in customer service. Chatbots, powered by machine learning algorithms, can handle customer inquiries, offer solutions to problems, and even process customer orders.

The rise of machine learning is also creating new job opportunities. While it may eliminate some jobs that involve repetitive tasks, it is expected to create new positions in fields like data analysis, machine learning engineering, and product management.

Moreover, machine learning is not limited to any particular industry. It has the potential to transform every sector of the economy, from finance to agriculture. Companies that adopt machine learning early on are likely to have a competitive edge over their rivals.

In conclusion, machine learning is a game-changer with enormous potential to revolutionize the way businesses operate and create new job opportunities. As it becomes more mainstream, it is essential for businesses to embrace this technology to remain competitive and stay ahead of the curve.",1
"Not to be that person who says ""I told you so,"" but a new study has concluded that pot smokers are not a bunch of lazy slackers but indeed well-adjusted human beings who cross a large swath of society's diverse types of individuals.

The landmark new study conducted by BDS Analytics, entitled ""Cannabis Consumers are Happy Campers,"" surveyed 2,000 California and Colorado adults, with a quota of 1,200 people who have used marijuana within the past six months.

The logic was to gather info from a population sample that was representative of the general public.

Their subjects, according to BDS's research division page, were comprised of ""consumers"" to ""acceptors,"" who don't consume but might consider it, as well as ""rejecters"" who don't consume and don't want to.

""One theme that clearly emerges from the research is the overall healthy well-being of cannabis consumers… when compared to 'acceptors' and 'rejecters,'"" the report reads, breaking down the myth of cannabis consumers and work ethic.

Researchers found that the average annual household income among California cannabis consumers is $93,800, compared to $72,800 for 'acceptors' and $75,900 for 'rejecters.'

Twenty percent of cannabis consumers also hold master's degrees, compared to 13 percent of 'acceptors' and 12 percent of 'rejecters.'

Colorado consumers were more satisfied with their lives now than they were a year ago and more likely to enjoy the fine arts, social activities and outdoor recreation than the acceptors and rejecters.

Sixty-four percent of Colorado consumers enjoyed being employed full-time, with just over 51 percent of acceptors and 54 percent of rejecters.

""Cannabis consumers are far removed from the caricatures historically used to describe them,"" said Linda Gilbert, head of the consumer research division at BDS Analytics. ""In fact, positive lifestyle indicators like volunteering, socializing, satisfaction with life and enjoyment of exercise and the outdoors are highest among cannabis consumers, at least in Colorado and California.""

The study will be updated every six months indefinitely. BDS will do its next research on this topic in Washington and Oregon.

""The aim is that this will eventually be a national study,"" Gilbert said. ""I hope and expect that 10 to 20 years from now, this study will still be continuing.""

""The thing everyone agrees on,"" Gilbert continued, ""is that cannabis can impair your ability to drive, and that we need tests to determine if you are driving under the influence.""

BDS Analytics is obsessed, in a good way, with gathering factual data within the cannabis sector and prides itself on ""enabling dispensaries, brands, and growers to sustain their success.""

"Machine Learning: The Future of Technology

Machine learning has taken the world by storm, revolutionizing the way we interact with technology. From self-driving cars to personalized music playlists, machine learning has become an essential part of our daily lives. But what exactly is machine learning, and how does it work?

At its core, machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves using algorithms and statistical models to analyze large amounts of data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on that information. This process is similar to how the human brain learns from experience and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

The applications of machine learning are virtually endless. In healthcare, it can be used to identify patterns in patient data and predict the likelihood of developing certain diseases. In finance, it can be used to detect fraud and optimize investment strategies. In marketing, it can be used to personalize advertising and improve customer engagement. The possibilities are limited only by our imagination.

However, as with any new technology, there are also concerns about the impact of machine learning on society. One concern is the potential for bias in algorithms that are trained on biased data. For example, if a machine learning algorithm is trained on data that is predominantly male, it may not perform as well for female users. Another concern is the potential for job displacement as machines become better at performing tasks previously done by humans.

Despite these concerns, the benefits of machine learning are clear. It has the potential to transform almost every industry and improve our lives in countless ways. As the technology continues to advance, it will be up to us to ensure that it is used ethically and responsibly.

In conclusion, machine learning is a game-changing technology that is already transforming the world we live in. As we look to the future, it will be crucial to continue to invest in research and development to ensure that we can fully harness the power of this incredible tool.",1
"Washington D.C. - The political world is buzzing about the recent actions of one of the nation's most prominent politicians, Senator Jane Smith. Senator Smith, who has been serving in the United States Senate for over a decade, has recently made headlines for her bold and controversial stance on immigration reform.

Senator Smith, a Republican from Texas, has gained national attention for her hard-line approach to immigration. She has been a vocal supporter of President Trump and his efforts to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and has been critical of her colleagues who have shown reluctance in supporting the President's immigration policies.

In a recent speech on the Senate floor, Senator Smith spoke passionately about the need to secure the border, citing the dangers of illegal immigration and the strain it places on the country's resources. She also called for the implementation of stricter policies, including the elimination of ""sanctuary cities"" and the deportation of all undocumented immigrants.

Senator Smith's stance on immigration has been met with praise from many Republicans, who see her as a strong and decisive leader on this issue. However, her views have also drawn criticism from Democrats and immigration activists, who argue that her policies are cruel and inhumane.

Despite the controversy surrounding her stance on immigration, Senator Smith remains a highly respected figure in Washington. She is known for her intelligence, her unwavering principles, and her ability to work across party lines to achieve meaningful progress.

As the nation continues to grapple with the complex issue of immigration reform, all eyes will be on Senator Jane Smith to see how she continues to lead the conversation and shape the future of our country's immigration policies.",1

Adopt-A-District Guide is the product of a partnership between Center for American Progress Action Fund, the Indivisible Project, Organizing for Action, Progressive Change Campaign Committee, and Town Hall Project.

Introduction

You've been trying to locate your missing Member of Congress (MoC), to attend a town hall or an event and let them hear your voice. They've been showing up for fundraisers and for votes—including to vote 'yes' on the House's cruel health care bill—but they won't do their jobs and have a town hall.

One thing is clear after the House of Representatives passed their cruel bill to strip away healthcare from 24 million Americans—members of Congress who voted for the administration's bill are not standing up for their constituents' best interests or listening to their concerns. This has effectively left millions of Americans without representation when they need it most.

Adopting a district is similar to hosting an empty chair town hall, except the person in the chair may be a neighboring or near-by member of Congress who is stepping in to help their peers' constituents who are being ignored.

NOTE FROM THE INDIVISIBLE TEAM REGARDING TRUMP'S FIRING OF JAMES COMEY Since this toolkit was produced, Trump fired James Comey, the director of the FBI who was also leading the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections and the potential involvement of the Trump campaign. At best, Trump's firing of a person who was investigating him shows poor judgment; at worst, it could be an obstruction of justice and an abuse of power. The biggest problem is what will happen now: Trump will appoint one of his cronies to lead the FBI, and the FBI's investigation will become a sham. We cannot trust Congress or a Trump FBI to conduct an impartial probe. Indivisible groups must not stop holding House members accountable on health care, but we also can't let Senators sit by and let Trump undermine our democracy. Call on your Senator to block all judicial and Department of Justice nominees until an independent law enforcement investigator, like a special prosecutor, is appointed. Our democracy demands nothing less.

Key Facts and Messaging

Key Facts

These are the facts about the Republican healthcare repeal bill that passed the House of Representatives:

The bill will cost American lives. That's not an exaggeration, it's a fact.

The bill, as written, will deny coverage to the millions of people who have pre-existing conditions who will be be stranded without affordable options for coverage.

Voting on a bill that affects 1/6th of the national economy, without a CBO score showing how much it will cost, is utterly reckless. The Senate must hold public hearings and get a CBO score.

Nearly 140 million Americans who get health care through their employer will not be spared—millions everywhere are at risk of losing protections against lifetime caps on insurance.

The bill would mean premium hikes for common issues; over $4,000 for a person with asthma, $8,000 for someone with depression and a whopping $17,000 for a pregnancy (WITHOUT any complications).

The bill cuts Medicaid by over $800 billion which will result in millions of the country's most vulnerable losing coverage, especially working families, children and people with disabilities—all for a tax cut to the wealthiest few.

Message Guidance

Passing health care reform was an historic achievement that truly changed the lives of families across the country, many of whom never had access to affordable care. Under Obamacare, 20 million more Americans have gained health care coverage and the nation's uninsured rate is at an all-time low. There are more positive steps that can be taken to continue this progress—but despite the rhetoric from its opponents, the health care law has never been more popular.

At the end of the day, 217 members sold out their constituents and proved they're nothing more than rubber stamps for this administration's destructive agenda. They decided it was more important to give the White House a 'win' than to stand up for families who have everything to lose.

A vote in favor of this legislation was a vote to punish people for getting sick, for getting older, for having less income, for being female—all to hand a massive tax giveaway to the rich. If this bill were signed into law, 24 million fewer people could have insurance, Medicaid would be slashed by nearly $1 trillion, protections for pre-existing conditions would be gutted, insurers would no longer be required to cover essential health benefits, and Planned Parenthood would be defunded.

Nobody truly believes this bill will make people's lives better. Not medical experts. Not health care providers. Not AARP or the American Cancer Society. Not the overwhelming majority of Americans. Not even the members who voted for it, who can't seem to explain what is good about this bill. And those representatives will continue to be held accountable by their constituents for",0

"Of course, there are already 15 physicians in Congress, and 13 are Republicans. Ralph Abraham is one of them: He practices family medicine in Louisiana and still sees patients a few times a month when he's not in D.C. His reasons for running in 2014 mirror Tran's: He wanted to fight for poor patients who were being priced out of healthcare. But unlike Tran, he blames the ACA for their woes. ""You can put those patients in a box and say, yeah, they've got insurance, but when it comes to pulling money out of their pocket, they can't,"" says Abraham.

Abraham ran for Congress at least partly to oppose the ACA, and he voted to repeal it earlier this month. He puts little stock on what he calls ""speculative"" estimates from the Congressional Budget Office that 24 million Americans—and poor, old, or sick ones, in particular—would lose their insurance under the AHCA. ""I'll be the first to admit that our Republican plan is not perfect and I hope we can modify it so it's better,"" he says. ""But what we have now is not working.""

Tran clearly disagrees. She feels that her physician peers in Congress are more interested in voting down the party line than in voting for their patients. She's not alone in thinking that. Several other physicians have recently felt compelled to enter the world of politics, especially after the recent attempts to repeal Obamacare.

""This is personal for me,"" says Jason Westin, an oncologist at MD Anderson Cancer Center who is running for the 7th seat in Texas. ""All of my patients have pre-existing conditions and I can't do anything in my current role to fight back for them. I've had a lot of patients who have problems with insurance. They're doing well in clinical trials of life-saving drugs, but their access is now threatened. This isn't a political football. This is going to hurt real people."" And he is perplexed by the Republican physicians who have voted for the AHCA. ""The Hippocratic oath I took said: First, do no harm,"" he says. ""How could someone else who took that same oath look at the same bill and support it? I don't know.""

Westin remembers a moment after the election when he saw his 5-year-old daughter fall down during a soccer game. ""I went over and saw that she was fine, so I told her that we don't fix our problems by complaining. We get back in the game. That night, I was venting on Facebook and realized that I'm a hypocrite. So I looked for ways to get in the game."" He realized that Hillary Clinton narrowly won his district in the 2016 election, even though Mitt Romney had easily carried the seat four year before. ""It's a highly educated area, with a major medical center. It's ripe for someone with a background in science and medicine to speak on political issues with authority.""

""If we make our healthcare system better, we need to focus on quality, access, and affordability—and I think the AHCA fails on all three areas,"" says Ryan Allen, an emergency physician based in Austin, who is considering a run in Texas's 21st district. If he does, he will go up against Lamar Smith, Chair of the House Science Committee, whose attitude towards scientific evidence is also motivating Allen's interest in politics. ""He has lately made a career of obstructing scientific exploration and the use of scientific data. I feel that threatens my kid's future, and I think one of the things that's missing from Congress is that ability to interpret data and turn it into public policy.""

"The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is one of the first agencies established by the United Nations to administer refugees, preceding even the creation of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The long history of UNRWA has long been built around its original mandate. The mandate, initially given by UN General Assembly Resolution 302 (IV), has been updated over the years. Today, UNRWA promises to deliver services as a ""neutral human development agency,"" according to Chris Gunness, a spokesperson at UNRWA.

Unfortunately, UNRWA has fallen prey to increasingly polarized and biased rhetoric, pushed more and more often by its own spokespersons. While Israel has raised concerns about Mr. Gunness in the past, there has been no action taken to ensure that Mr. Gunness is returned to the realm of unbiased behavior befitting a human development agency whose mandate, he admits, must include neutrality.

Advertisement

As the Israeli letter to the UN Commissioner-General of UNRWA (Pierre Krähenbühl) details, Mr. Gunness has promoted and praised individuals who buy into the ideology of Hamas, an internationally recognized terrorist organization. Mr. Gunness has discussed the suffering of Palestinian refugees, but conveniently leaves out responsibility for their suffering, going so far as to omit the responsibility of Hamas in disrupting power to 70,000 Gazans by firing a rocket (a by-definition indiscriminate weapon) at Israel.

However, Mr. Gunness has not only escaped investigation, he has persisted in his continued violations of the neutrality principle that underlines UNRWA's mandate. His prolific posts on Twitter are indication of this trend. On August 28, 2015, at 12:21AM (GMT-7), Mr. Gunness tweeted:

""Thx @levy_haaretz 4 exposing the pitilessness of the ""bureaucrats"" of #IsraeliOccupation"". They r many & variedhttp://www.haaretz.com/weekend/twilight-zone/.premium-1.673301 … RT""

(If embeddable, here is link to tweet: https://twitter.com/ChrisGunness/status/637163117051518976).

The ""bureaucrats"", unnamed figures in the article, are doubtless officials of the Israeli government. Rather than maintain an unbiased and neutral view of Israel, Mr. Gunness has both praised and taken immediate sides on an issue related to human interests without investigation of his own. He further accuses Israeli officials of ""pitilessness"", yet another insult towards the Israeli officials his organization is meant to cooperate with in an unbiased fashion. This conduct is unbecoming for any UNRWA official, let alone a spokesperson.

Another obvious example of Mr. Gunness' failures to remain unbiased can be found mere days before. On August 26, 2015, at 4:17PM (GMT-7), Mr. Gunness tweeted the following:

""Interested to find out more about UN Watch's political & financial affiliations since its establishment. Can anyone advise? RT""

His tweet was not a legitimate and neutral attempt to investigate an organization, of course. Just a few days earlier, on August 23, 2015, UN Watch informed UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon that an UNRWA school had posted violence-inciting cartoons on its Facebook page.

Mr. Gunness' tweet thus reeks of attempted retaliation, and he solicited information from the social media world in his attempt to find information which he might, presumably, be able to smear UN Watch with. UN Watch, which is a Geneva-based non-governmental organization acting as a watchdog for the United Nations, has been praised by former UN Secretary Generals and other high-ranking officials for their work, and is an accredited NGO assisting numerous UN bodies. Rather than acknowledge the criticism of this UNRWA school and thank UN Watch for their work in keeping UNRWA accountable and neutral, Mr. Gunness decided to block and ignore UN Watch on Twitter.

In light of this, and numerous other documented examples of Chris Gunness' failure to be both accountable and neutral it is up to the United Nations to take action. Clearly the long history of bias and violations of UNRWA policy have failed to inspire the United Nations to take action, and it is time that the world called on the United Nations to appoint neutral, unbiased spokespersons for an agency crucial to the administering of aid for Palestinians. Only with a more neutral and diplomatic individual speaking on behalf of UNRWA can the organization continue to properly function and mediate between the parties of the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and ensure that it is seen as a credible UN agency.",0

Yes. Seriously, it took me 30 seconds to find this. Google Scholar is your friend.

3. Could you please provide scientific evidence which can prove that disease reduction in any part of the world, at any point in history was attributable to inoculation of populations?

4. Could you please explain how the safety and mechanism of vaccines in the human body are scientifically proven if their pharmacokinetics (the study of bodily absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of ingredients) are never examined or analyzed in any vaccine study?

You can't study the pharmacokinetics of something which is not physically acting on the body—rather, vaccines are designed to be acted upon. I can't answer this; not because of a conspiracy, but because this is an unanswerable question. It's like asking, ""Why haven't they studied the mating habits of tennis shoes?""

5. Could you please provide scientific justification as to how injecting a human being with a confirmed neurotoxin is beneficial to human health and prevents disease?

Neurotoxins are a matter of dosage, just like radiation, and all interventions are a risk-benefit ratio. You accept the risk of getting a chest x-ray if you might have pneumonia because the dose is very low, and you won't have it done repeatedly. Also, for something to be a neurotoxin and have effects on the brain, it must be able to pass the blood-brain barrier. This is very, very difficult and chemists spend their entire lives trying to design something that will get across. Just because something can be toxic doesn't mean it is, just because something has risk doesn't mean it's not worth doing, and just because something has theoretical potential to do harm doesn't mean that it will do harm.

‎6. Can you provide a risk/benefit profile on how the benefits of injecting a known neurotoxin exceeds its risks to human health for the intended goal of preventing disease?

See the above study on measles vaccines saving hundreds of thousands of lives . Any risk of ""injecting a known neurotoxin"" (Which one? At what dose? Neurotoxic to who? Correlation or causative?) is unequivocally lower than the very real and potentially lethal risk of an outbreak in an unvaccinated community or one with a low uptake.

7. Could you please provide scientific justification on how bypassing the respiratory tract (or mucous membrane) is advantageous and how directly injecting viruses into the bloodstream enhances immune functioning and prevents future infections?

Different parts of your body have different types of antibodies associated with them. In the mucous membranes of your body, like the GI tract and the respiratory tract, white blood cells at the membrane produce IgA antibodies on exposure to a pathogen. In the blood stream, you have direct access to the memory cells which produce IgGs: the more robust antibodies that provide lifetime immunity against a particular pathogen. Those memory cells will stay in your lymph nodes, ready to produce an onslaught of deadly (to the pathogen) IgGs whenever the body recognizes it again. IgAs are incapable of this, and many respiratory pathogens are defeated after exposure by the body's initial defences, before an specific set of antibodies can ever be manufactured.

8. Could you please provide scientific justification on how a vaccine would prevent viruses from mutating?

"""It can't be easy, that's all I'm saying…"", And Kate wants to yell it out, that of course it isn't easy, that that much should be obvious. She wants to howler at the one who presents herself as her friend, and she wants to kick and scream; She wants to foam at the mouth, and she wants her reply to be sharp.


But of course Kate knows that she would never do any of those things. It's just isn't how she was raised. Besides it's Max that's talking to her, and Max doesn't deserve any of her rage.


A lot can be said for the plastic smiles and little snarky comments that Kate has fallen victim to lately, she feels - herself - in part guilty for what happened. How can she not? It was her decision, and it was her drink and - no matter what happened, no matter if she was tricked into going with a false pretense or not, she still went. And no matter how many times Max tells her it wasn't her fault she can't quite believe it.


Maybe it's punishment for her feelings. Divine intervention in a way? Kate doesn't know if she should cry or yell out. She's confused. Everything in her mind is fuzzy, has been for so long now. Ever since she met Max that first day.


Not that she can't separate what she feels, from how she should feel, it's just hard - harder than it should be - and she has more pressing issues in her mind. And she can't quite push herself to yell at Max, or at anyone really. She's just defeated, pushed and abused and tired. All the things her mother and family warned her about and yet -


It truly is hard to be a philistine, to be able to enjoy the delicate curves in the nape of Max's neck, or the way her eyes glitter when she smiles, or even the way there's this slight hesitation, how her mouth slowly curves upwards, before she speaks. If there's something Kate truly appreciates about her object of desire, about the one that she met in that ill fated day, is that she's always positive. Like a Proton, not that Kate has always paid much attention to science class but she knows that Max is like one. She never seems to doubt, question, or give up. Like she's lived through stuff a thousand times and she knows what she's doing.


Kate is just about to go into how she would like to know what she, herself is doing with her life; How she'd like a plan, a guide to follow that's not the one her family brought upon her - because that one has been failed, so so hard - When Max speaks.

It takes her a moment to catch on all the levity on Max's voice. The way she half shrugs and does her best to make her feel better. It comes naturally to her. Not an edge to her voice, not one ounce of tension. It's like she practiced this moment over and over. Kate would really know how she's able to do it so easily.


Maybe it isn't easy, but that just how it seems to her. Max is practically perfect at this stuff, but then what is Max not good at?


""Hello, earth to Kate, are you ok?"" , Again, the same question, just more directly asked . It has never been easy being her, and no, she's not ok. But she's sure that Max can't do much more than she did to help her. And why bother pointing it out? She's probably only running on her good will.

Kate attempts to smile. Attempts being the key word there, she isn't quite sure if she succeeds, wh a t with every single doubt in her he ad multiplied tenfold. She isn't sure if Max buys it or not, but, as much as she wishes to be able to pass all her doubts as momentary, little chimps in her armor, she isn't all that sure that is possible.

She has read the messages, straight from her family. She knows what people think of her. Heck she knows her reputation, and what every action and word she has ever said has been invalidated, like it's purely a front.


And then Max touches her. Kate can't help it, she recoils at the contact. What is wrong with her? Why can't she even be touched by the one she dares call a friend without retreating into herself? How can she prove to Max she's fine like that? Hands caressing her cross like it is the only thing she still has as a base, tears that insist on creeping into her eyes, smile that rings untrue?

Max, blessed might she be, understands her mistake and too, retreats. Pushing herself away from Kate, leaving her wondering if this is it, if Max is giving",0

Research on how bacteria adapt to changing environments underlies the contemporary biological understanding of signal transduction (ST), and ST provides the foundation of the information-processing approach that is the hallmark of the 'cognitive revolution,' which began in the mid-20th century. Yet cognitive scientists largely remain oblivious to research into microbial behavior that might provide insights into problems in their own domains, while microbiologists seem equally unaware of the potential importance of their work to understanding cognitive capacities in multicellular organisms, including vertebrates. Evidence in bacteria for capacities encompassed by the concept of cognition is reviewed. Parallels exist not only at the heuristic level of functional analogue, but also at the level of molecular mechanism, evolution and ecology, which is where fruitful cross-fertilization among disciplines might be found.

The review is organized into two parts. Part 1 provides an introduction to the study of cognition. Part 2 sets out a proposed bacterial cognitive toolkit. Because there is a great deal of ground to cover, and not a lot of space to cover it in, the mechanisms of how systems work will be sketched in broad outline, not in detail, except in those cases where the details are either not widely known or not easily accessible in the literature. The aim here is to stimulate microbiologists to think about their work in the broader context of a cognitive biology ( Kovác, 2000 ; Auletta, 2011 ; Bechtel, 2014 ; Fitch, 2014 ) and to consider designing experiments to explicitly enhance this understanding.

In the hope of stimulating interest among microbiologists in this area, this review brings together contemporary evidence for cognition in eubacteria in core areas of cognitive research: sensory ST, valence, communication, sensorimotor coordination, memory, learning, anticipation, and decision making in complex and changing circumstances. The article will show that parallels exist not only at the heuristic level of functional analog, but also at the level of molecular mechanism, evolution and ecology, which is where fruitful cross-fertilization among disciplines might be found. Archaea, whose behavior is less well documented and appear (so far) to possess far fewer ST systems than bacteria ( Ulrich and Zhulin, 2010 ), will not be discussed here.

Yet, while work on bacterial adaptation underlies the contemporary biological understanding of sensory ST ( Wadhams and Armitage, 2004 ), and ST in turn provides the foundation of the information-processing approach to cognition that (rightly or wrongly) remains the hallmark of the 'cognitive revolution' ( Miller, 2003 ), cognitive scientists are largely oblivious to research in this and other areas of microbial behavior that might provide insights into problems in their own domains. For example, some flagellated bacterial species, paradigmatically Escherichia coli, have been found to possess large clusters of interacting sensory receptors, typically at the leading pole of the cell, which function as complex information-processing units linked to motor activity ( Hazelbauer et al., 2007 ) and have been dubbed by some a 'nanobrain' ( Webre et al., 2003 ). Meanwhile, microbiologists seem equally unaware of the potential importance of their work to understanding cognitive capacities in metazoans including vertebrates.

The idea that microbes might know their world, not merely bump into it, is controversial but unoriginal. At the beginning of the 20th century, Jennings (1905/1962 ) claimed the behavior of the 'lower animals,' notably paramecia but including bacteria, could tell us much about the behavior of the 'higher animals,' including humans. The Animal Mind ( Washburn, 1936 ), the first US textbook on comparative psychology (first edition 1908), begins with amoeba. Biochemist Daniel Koshland provided the modern scientific equivalent of Jennings' argument in an under-appreciated monograph on bacterial chemotaxis (CT) as a model system for the study of behavior, and remarked (following Pope) that ""the proper study of mankind is the bacterium"" ( Koshland, 1980b ). Philosopher of science Karl Popper went further and argued (only slightly tongue-in-cheek) that in the evolution of problem-solving ""from the amoeba to Einstein is just one step"" ( Popper, 1999 ).

Keep in mind that a great deal of complexity will be obscured in the simplifications that follow. In each cell of E. coli, for example, which is not the smartest proteobacterium on the block (but no dummy, either), there are upward of 10,000 chemoreceptors per cell, each with",0

Curveball

The New Yorker, November 28, 1994

STEPHEN JAY GOULD

The Bell Curve, by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray (Free Press; $30), subtitled Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life, provides a superb and unusual opportunity to gain insight into the meaning of experiment as a method in science. The primary desideratum in all experiments is reduction of confusing variables: we bring all the buzzing and blooming confusion of the external world into our laboratories and, holding all else constant in our artificial simplicity, try to vary just one potential factor at a time. But many subject defy the use of such an experimental method—particularly most social phenomena—because importation into the laboratory destroys the subject of the investigation, and then we must yearn for simplifying guides in nature. If the external world occasionally obliges by holding some crucial factors constant for us, we can only offer thanks for this natural boost to understanding.

So, when a book garners as much attention as The Bell Curve, we wish to know the causes. One might suspect the content itself—a startlingly new idea, or an old suspicion newly verified by persuasive data—but the reason might also be social acceptability, or even just plain hype. The Bell Curve, with its claims and supposed documentation that race and class differences are largely cause by genetic factors and are therefore essentially immutable, contains no new arguments and presents no compelling data to support its anachronistic social Darwinism, so I can only conclude that its success in winning attention must reflect the depressing temper of our time—a historical moment of unprecedented ungenerosity, when a mood for slashing social programs can be powerfully abetted by an argument that beneficiaries cannot be helped, owing to inborn cognitive limits expressed as low IQ scores.

The Bell Curve rests on two distinctly different but sequential arguments, which together encompass the classic corpus of biological determinism as a social philosophy. The first argument rehashes the tenets of social Darwinism as it was originally constituted. ""Social Darwinism"" has often been used as a general term for any evolutionary argument about the biological basis of human differences, but the initial nineteenth–century meaning referred to a specific theory of class stratification with industrial societies, and particularly to the idea that there was a permanently poor underclass consisting of genetically inferior people who had precipitated down into their inevitable fate. The theory arose from a paradox of egalitarianism: as long as people remain on top of the social heap by accident of a noble name or parental wealth, and as long as members of despised castes cannot rise no matter what their talents, social stratification will not reflect intellectual merit, and brilliance will be distributed across all classes; but when true equality of opportunity is attained smart people rise and the lower classes become rigid, retaining only the intellectually incompetent.

This argument has attracted a variety of twentieth–century champions, including the Stanford psychologist Lewis M. Terman, who imported Alfred Binet's original test from France, developed the Stanford–Binet IQ test, and gave a hereditarian interpretation to the results (one that Binet had vigorously rejected in developing this style of test); Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, who tried to institute a eugenics program of rewarding well–educated women for higher birth rates; and Richard Herrnstein, a co–author of The Bell Curve and also the author of a 1971 Atlantic Monthly article that presented the same argument without the documentation. The general claim is neither uninteresting nor illogical, but it does require the validity of four shaky premises, all asserted (but hardly discussed or defended) by Herrnstein and Murray. Intelligence, in their formulation, must be depictable as a single number, capable of ranking people in linear order, genetically based, and effectively immutable. If any of these premises are false, their entire argument collapses. For example, if all are true except immutability, then programs for early intervention in education might work to boost IQ permanently, just as a pair of eyeglasses may correct a genetic defect in vision. The central argument of The Bell Curve fails because most of the premises are false.

Herrnstein and Murray's second claim, the lightning rod for most commentary extends the argument for innate cognitive stratification to a claim that racial differences in IQ are mostly determined by genetic causes—small difference for Asian superiority over Caucasian, but large for Caucasians over people of African descent. This argument is as old as the study of race,",0
"In recent years, the educational system of Finland has gained worldwide recognition for its excellence in providing quality education to its students. The Finnish model of education has become a benchmark for other European countries, and many have tried to replicate its unique approach to learning.

One of the main features of the Finnish system is its focus on individualized learning. Rather than having a one-size-fits-all approach to education, Finnish schools prioritize the needs of each student and tailor their learning experience accordingly. This means that students are given the freedom to choose their own path of learning, which helps them develop their skills and interests at their own pace.

Another distinctive aspect of the Finnish system is its emphasis on play-based learning. Young children are not subjected to rigorous academic schedules at an early age, but instead, they are encouraged to engage in creative and exploratory play. This approach helps children develop their natural curiosity and love for learning, setting them up for success later on in their academic journey.

Teachers also play a significant role in the Finnish system. Unlike other countries where teachers are evaluated based on their students' test scores, Finnish teachers are trusted to make their own decisions about how to teach their students. They are highly educated and respected professionals who are given a lot of autonomy to design their own curriculum and create a positive learning environment in their classrooms.

In addition, the Finnish system provides equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their socio-economic background. Education is free for all students, and the government provides financial support to families who need it. This ensures that every child has an equal chance to succeed and that no one is left behind.

In conclusion, the Finnish model of education is a shining example of how an educational system can be designed to prioritize the needs of its students. Its emphasis on individualized learning, play-based education, and teacher autonomy has led to exceptional results, and many other European countries are looking to adopt these practices in their own systems.",1

"We consider how valid conclusions often lay hidden within research reports, masked by plausible but unjustified conclusions reached in those reports. We employ several well-known and cross-cutting examples from the psychological literature to illustrate how, independent (or in the absence) of replicability difficulties or questionable research practices leading to false positives, motivated reasoning and confirmation biases can lead to drawing unjustified conclusions. In describing these examples, we review strategies and methods by which researchers can identify such practices in their own and others' research reports. These strategies and methods can unmask hidden phenomena that may conflict with researchers' preferred narratives, in order to ultimately produce more sound and valid scientific conclusions. We conclude with general recommendations for how social psychologists can limit the influence of interpretive biases in their own and others' research, and thereby elevate the scientific status and validity of social psychology.",0

"As highest quality of care continues not to be the emphasis in the health care debate— let alone be on par with discussions around access, Canadian health systems remain in the spotlight. This time, multiple hospitals in southern Ontario shut their doors to the sickest of babies due to lack of beds for a 10% patient surge compared to the same time period last year.

According to Shawn Whatley, president of Ontario Medical Association, while pleading for increased funding, ""These are our sickest patients. This is a reflection of our whole system. Our system is stretched to max capacity. We're often forced to do more and more with less and less.""

It is reported the Toronto Central Local Health Integration Network (LHIN) insists ""no babies have been turned away as they started using temporary beds for the babies when they got to capacity."" This statement baffles me. In fact, it exemplifies a fundamental lack of understanding of what is required for resuscitation of an extreme premature baby as well as those born with the most serious of health conditions.

Placing a baby in a bassinet that is temporary does not save a life, let alone maintain one. These are infants necessitating neonatal intensive care services. If the appropriate equipment is not provided along with one-to-one staffing to monitor continuous vital signs, apnea (cessation of breathing), potential hypothermia or hypoglycemia (too low blood sugar) among innumerable other challenges that are common occurrences in this population, then what does a crib actually do?

The answer: not provide medical care.

Electrolyte repletion in infants—as well as medications in them and pediatric patients, in general— is based on weight. Each calculation is crucial and must be precise or literally fatal arrhythmias, fluid overload and the like can develop. While they can be quite resilient, newborns with certain congenital disorders requiring timely surgical correction or those with severe lung immaturity demanding basic supplemental oxygen from nasal cannula to mechanical ventilation won't necessarily survive, let alone thrive. Delays in this arena mean the difference in life or death as well as short- and long-term disability.

Again, not doing things correctly from the outset in the medical realm not only places an individual with a disease at a deficit, but it initiates a trajectory that leads to more heroic costly and invasive measures, increased anxiety and suffering, progression of illness, unnecessary adverse effects and poorer ultimate outcomes. Bandaids don't repair ruptured arteries. And, as a policy tenet they yield not only what Ontario is battling, but also the recent struggles of the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS).

In More Bad News For Single Payer Health System, I wrote about an NHS recent report generated out of London that paints a grim picture about systemic failings in healthcare of the sickest patients. Citing high mortality rates —more than one in three died— due to sub-standard practices, The National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death. Inspiring Change reveals the sad reality of care quality reduction when resources limit appropriate staffing and equipment supply for ever increasing patient volumes. The care was rated as less than good for every four out of five cases. In this article, I touch upon the much improved survival rates in the United States compared to these populations.

In Rough Week For Government-Run Healthcare, I focus on news from NHS England that the number of people waiting for routine surgery now exceeds 4 million. The highest in a decade. The BBC went on to report ""Other targets missed include the four-hour target in A&E and urgent referrals for cancer care."" Sky News wrote ""Dr Mark Holland, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the latest figures were ""shocking"" and represent ""another damning indictment of the crisis we are experiencing in the NHS."" The sentiment further echoed by ""Danny Mortimer, deputy chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health organizations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and chief executive of NHS Employers, called the system ""unsustainable.""""

Even childbirth had catastrophic ramifications leading to a reversal of the ""normal"" or ""natural birth"" campaign by the Royal College of Midwives. Infant and maternal morbidity and mortality cannot best be avoided when training is disparate and physician involvement or obstetric care is withheld. See here to learn more about the investigations into unnecessary deaths and the perpetuation of dangerous deliveries.

The picture out of Canada echoes the same recurrent themes:

excessive wait times for countless populations— a monetary, physical, emotional and ethical toll.

poor nurse to patient ratios and improper assignments of appropriately trained personnel

lack of equipment exacerbating rationing of care— who's life is of greater value?

bad patient outcomes

increased ""burnout"" and staff—e.g. nursing, physician— shortages (1)

Outsourcing such deficiencies to the United States and elsewhere is not uncommon.",0
"Mathematics: The Language of the Universe

Mathematics is arguably the most important subject that is taught in schools and universities around the world. It is the study of numbers, shapes, patterns, and relationships, and is used to solve problems in almost every field of study, from science and engineering to finance and economics.

Mathematics has a long and rich history. It can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Greeks, who developed mathematical concepts and theories that are still relevant today. Over the centuries, mathematics has evolved and expanded, with new branches such as calculus, geometry, algebra, and statistics being developed.

One of the most fascinating aspects of mathematics is its ability to describe and explain the natural world. Mathematics is used to model and predict the behavior of everything from subatomic particles to galaxies, and is essential to many scientific fields, including physics, chemistry, and biology.

In addition to its scientific applications, mathematics is also critical to the modern economy. It is used to make financial decisions, such as investment strategies and risk management, and is essential to the functioning of industries such as insurance, banking, and manufacturing.

Despite its importance, mathematics is often seen as a difficult and intimidating subject. Many students struggle with the abstract concepts and complex formulas, leading to a negative perception of the subject. However, with the right approach and guidance, anyone can develop a strong foundation in mathematics and learn to appreciate its beauty and power.

To promote the study of mathematics, many organizations and institutions around the world hold events and competitions to showcase the talents of young mathematicians. These events provide opportunities for students to test their skills against their peers, and to gain recognition for their achievements.

In conclusion, mathematics is a fundamental part of our world, and its importance cannot be overstated. From the natural world to the economy, mathematics provides the tools and language to describe and understand the complex systems that surround us.

"Generative AI: The Future of Technology

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that is making waves in the world of technology and is changing the way we interact with machines. Generative AI has the potential to generate creative outputs, which can range from music and art to design and writing. It has the ability to create new content that is personalized and tailored to the user's requirements.

Generative AI is a type of machine learning that is focused on creating new content instead of just analyzing it. The technology is capable of generating new and unique content by understanding patterns and relationships in data. This means that it can create content that has never been seen before, which is a valuable tool for businesses looking to differentiate themselves from their competitors.

One of the most significant advantages of generative AI is that it is highly personalized. It can create content that is tailored to the user's preferences, which is a valuable tool for businesses looking to engage their customers. This means that businesses can create content that is highly relevant to their customers, which can increase their engagement and loyalty.

Generative AI is also highly efficient. It can generate large amounts of content in a short amount of time, which is a valuable tool for businesses looking to improve their productivity and efficiency. This means that businesses can create more content in less time, which can help them to stay ahead of their competitors.

Despite the many advantages of generative AI, there are also some concerns about the technology. One of the biggest concerns is that the technology could be used to create fake news or propaganda. This is a concern because generative AI can create highly persuasive content that is designed to influence people's opinions.

Another concern is that generative AI could be used to automate jobs that were previously done by humans. This could lead to job losses and a shift in the job market. However, proponents of the technology argue that it could actually create new job opportunities, especially in the creative industries.

In conclusion, generative AI is a technology that has the potential to change the way we interact with machines. It has the ability to generate new and unique content, which is highly personalized and tailored to the user's requirements. While there are concerns about the technology, proponents argue that it could actually create new job opportunities and improve productivity and efficiency. It is clear that generative AI is the future of technology and businesses that embrace it will be well-positioned for success.",1
"During the Sundance Film Festival, Park City locals are often treated like second-class citizens, unable to get a table at their favorite restaurant — or any restaurant — because directors, producers and other industry folks fill the seats or the space has been reserved for private parties.

One exception is Karleen's Uptown Fare, where Hollywood types get the snub.

For the 10-day run of the festival, which starts Thursday, Jan. 17, owner Karleen Reilly hangs a large banner outside her soup-and-sandwich shop at the top of Main Street that reads ""locals only club."" She also stations a doorman at the main entrance who politely turns away anyone from out of town.

""I have a password, but I pretty much know all the locals"" said the no-nonsense Reilly. ""Besides, you can tell a Sundancer a mile away. It's pretty obvious.""

This will be the fifth year that Reilly has made residents royalty. Her decision to go rogue is a way to thank the regular diners who support her the rest of the year. ""I've had some devoted customers who have been coming for a long time,"" she said. ""I think they appreciate it.""

She also does it to help film festival volunteers, most of whom call Utah home. ""They only have a certain amount of time to get lunch,"" she said. ""They know they can run in here and get a quick meal in 15 or 20 minutes.""

It hasn't always been this way. Years ago, when Reilly — and the festival — were just starting out, everyone was welcome in the tiny shop at 227 S. Main, next to the Treasure Mountain Inn. Reilly proudly points to the photographs of actors Nick Nolte, Minnie Driver, Billy Bush, Scott Wolf and others who came in and enjoyed her food.

But a few years ago, the festival outgrew her restaurant, which only seats about 20 people. ""They would camp out in here with their computers, order two cups of coffee and stay four hours,"" Reilly said. ""I don't want that or need that.""

She could have closed down for the festival, but that's not her style. Of course, Reilly's not heartless as some rumors suggest. ""I don't turn away pregnant women and children,"" she said. ""And skiers are always welcome.""

A long-time Park City resident, Reilly opened Uptown Fare about 13 years ago after spending more than a decade as a caterer. ""I had always thought about opening a place,"" she said, ""and then one day I heard Oprah talking about how if you do what you love, you will do well.""

Today, she operates the restaurant with the help of her daughter, Nivin Lloyd, and employee Beth Falk. Locals are drawn to this hidden gem for its unpretentious atmosphere and menu. Low ceilings, narrow eating spaces and an eclectic mix of donated furniture and thrift-store finds makes it feel like your grandmother's kitchen. There's even a sign that reads ""There will be $5.00 charge for Whining,"" a nice change from the white-tablecloth establishments that fill Park City's Main Street.

Uptown Fare's menu includes several different homemade soups, that rotate with the seasons and Reilly's culinary whims. There also are sandwiches made from fresh roasted meats, salads and baked goods. While customers say it's all delicious, the restaurant is best known for its tomato bisque and turkey/cranberry sandwich.

Every day Reilly carves her way through a whole roasted turkey, which she special orders from North Carolina. When all the meat has been served on sandwiches and salads, the carcass is used to make a variation of turkey soup.

""We get here as often as we can,"" said customer Kellee Shea, during a recent visit with her youngest daughter, Savannah

Shea, wife of 2002 Olympic gold medalist in skeleton Jimmy Shea — whose photo is also on the wall— said the turkey/cranberry sandwich is her favorite. "" I'm usually planning around breakfast to come here and get it for lunch.""

Greg Gaudet is another ski season regular. Last week, he brought in a group of friends to try the food and meet ""the characters who work here."" He tells his guests about the ""locals only"" policy and said he appreciates that the atmosphere doesn't change just because Hollywood decides to drops in for a few days.

""It's a family place,"" he said. ""And everyone that comes in you know.""

"Feminist Tumblr is about many things, but in general it's about young women who hate the whole world and everyone in it. Marina is an ""intersectional feminist and a human rights advocate"" who hates the whole world because everybody is sexist and she recounts the various hassles she must endure before she finally blows up and calls her boss ""a sexist a–hole,"" which is not her fault:

this is what sexism does – it makes it impossible to win if you're a girl, or a woman, it makes your entire existance an uphill battle. and truth be told, i am getting so f–king tired. i am 23, a quarter of my life behind me, and i am already tired of educating men twice my age about what is right and appropriate. i am tired of the stares that say i am over-reacting, the replies to calm down, the polite smiles that are meant to knock me down a few pegs. i am tired of explaining to men that sexism is not this one incident, it is my entire life, my every single day. i am 23 and i am so f–king exhausted.

See? She needs to educate us about ""what is right and appropriate"" because she is 23 and an expert on everything, while the rest of us (especially men twice her age) are clueless idiots.

This is why we cannot simply laugh at feminism's death-grip on college education. Young women emerge from the protective campus cocoon — where no one is permitted to criticize feminism — and enter a world where most people don't spend their days worrying about ""human rights"" and ""intersectionality."" In the real world, people have work to do and bills to pay, and the last thing they need is for some young fanatic fresh out of college, hired for an entry-level position, to go crazy in the office because somebody made a joke she didn't like.

Feminism makes women unemployable.

A paranoid worldview that perceives misogyny and social injustice everywhere renders feminists incapable of functioning in normal life. Because success in the real world requires cooperation and teamwork, a hostile chip-on-your-shoulder attitude is no more conducive to professional success than it is to personal happiness.

One more thing, sweetheart: You misspelled ""existence.""

"Machine Learning: The Future of Technology

In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for businesses and researchers alike. At its core, machine learning is the practice of teaching computers to recognize patterns and make decisions based on those patterns. This can be used for a wide variety of applications, from predicting future trends in financial data to identifying which patients are at highest risk for disease.

One of the key advantages of machine learning is its ability to process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately. This makes it ideal for applications like fraud detection, where it can quickly identify patterns of suspicious behavior and alert investigators. It can also be used to analyze customer data to identify patterns in purchasing behavior, which can help businesses tailor their marketing efforts to specific customer segments.

Many researchers are also exploring the potential of machine learning in areas like healthcare and environmental monitoring. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze medical images and identify potential tumors or other abnormalities. Similarly, they can be used to model the behavior of complex ecosystems, such as coral reefs or rainforests, helping researchers better understand the impact of human activity on these delicate systems.

Of course, machine learning is not without its challenges. One of the biggest obstacles is developing algorithms that are both accurate and reliable. This requires careful attention to detail and a deep understanding of the data being analyzed. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential for bias in machine learning systems, particularly when it comes to issues like hiring or lending decisions.

Despite these challenges, machine learning is widely regarded as one of the most promising areas of technology today. As more and more businesses and researchers harness its power, it has the potential to reshape our world in ways that we can only begin to imagine.",1
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal jury in Brooklyn on Monday found a former New York Democratic state senator, whose brief flirtation with the Republican party gridlocked the senate, guilty of embezzling money from federally funded healthcare clinics.

New York State Senator Pedro Espada joins other legislators in a news conference on the steps of City Hall in New York City, demanding Mayor Bloomberg negotiate with them before they vote to reinstate his control of the largest school system in the United States, July 19, 2009. REUTERS/Chip East

But the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on related conspiracy charges.

Pedro Espada Jr. and his son, Pedro Gautier Espada, were accused of bilking more than $600,000 from Soundview HealthCare Center, which has received more than $1 million in federal funding. The elder Espada, a former three-term Democratic senator representing the Bronx, serves as CEO of Soundview, which was founded in 1978.

After 11 days of tense deliberations, the jury on Monday told U.S. District Judge Frederic Block that Espada, 58, was guilty of four counts of theft. The jury then deliberated for several more hours before announcing they were unable to reach a verdict on the remaining four counts against Espada, which included theft and conspiracy.

A mistrial was declared on all eight counts against Pedro Gautier Espada.

Block gave prosecutors until June 5 to decide whether to retry the Espadas on all or some of the undetermined counts.

After the verdict was read, Espada appeared somber, comforting his wife in the courtroom.

""It's a sad day for Mr. Espada, and a sadder day for Soundview and the community,"" Espada's attorney, Susan Necheles, said outside the courthouse.

Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said Espada will ""now be held to account for his crimes.""

""The people of the Bronx trusted Pedro Espada to have their best interests at heart,"" Lynch said in a statement following the verdict. ""Instead, he abused that trust to the tune of more than half a million dollars.""

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also weighed in on the verdict, calling Espada ""the prime example of government corruption.""

ACCUSATIONS OF BULLYING

Deliberations nearly ground to a halt several times in the two weeks since the jury received the case. On Wednesday, Block told jurors to resume deliberations after they sent him a note that they were ""deadlocked."" In other notes, there were complaints that one juror refused to deliberate and accusations of bullying.

During the six-week trial, witnesses for the government included Maria Cruz, Espada's long-time assistant, who said he put family members on Soundview's payroll and its board of directors.

Other Soundview employees testified that Espada routinely spent clinic funds on personal items like presents and flowers, fancy meals and even an elaborate child's birthday party featuring a pony. The Espadas also were accused of rigging bids for cleaning contracts with Soundview.

Necheles acknowledged during the trial that her client spent Soundview's money, but only as part of his contract, which entitled him to pay certain personal expenses with company funds. If any of the funds were used improperly, it was the fault of Soundview's accountants, who apparently green-lit the payments, she said.

Espada, who served as New York Senate majority leader from 2009 until 2010, was ousted from his Senate seat in the 2010 primary election. He faces up to 40 years in prison for the counts on which he has been convicted.

His son, who was a member of the New York Assembly and helped his father run parts of Soundview, faced 10 years on each of the five counts of theft, and 15 years on the three conspiracy counts.",0

"Kiev, Ukraine - The conflict in eastern Ukraine has escalated once again as government forces clashed with pro-Russian separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The violence has left several civilians and soldiers dead and many more injured.

The conflict began in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, citing historical and ethnic ties. Since then, fighting between Ukrainian forces and separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which have declared themselves independent republics, has been ongoing.

The latest surge in violence comes after weeks of tension, with both sides accusing the other of violating a ceasefire agreement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of supporting the separatists, a claim that Moscow has denied.

The Ukrainian military has reported that several of its soldiers were killed and wounded in the latest outbreak of fighting. Meanwhile, separatist leaders have reported that at least five civilians, including a child, were killed in shelling by Ukrainian forces.

The conflict has taken a heavy toll on the people of Ukraine, with thousands of civilians killed and many more displaced. The situation has also strained relations between Russia and the West, with the United States and European Union imposing economic sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea and support for the separatists.

Both sides have called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, but with tensions running high, it remains to be seen whether a lasting ceasefire can be achieved. The international community has called for an end to the violence and a return to negotiations, but with so much at stake for both sides, the road to peace is likely to be a long and difficult one.",1
"Bonnie Brewer is a former official mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers, appearing at Milwaukee County Stadium from 1973 to 1979. Bonnie was portrayed as a young blonde woman in a gold blouse and short blue lederhosen, wearing a baseball cap and frequently carrying a blue-and-gold broom which she would use to sweep the bases. The first Bonnie in 1973 was Donna Bozmoski, a sophomore at Brookfield East High School, Brookfield, Wisconsin.

Bonnie was first introduced as the female companion to the Brewers' mascot Bernie Brewer. Bernie and Bonnie were created by then-team vice president Dick Hackett as part of an effort to create a lively atmosphere at County Stadium, which also included hiring organist Frank Charles to play a Wurlitzer during the games. As Hackett remembers it, Bernie and Bonnie were added over the objections of team owner Bud Selig.

Bonnie was noted mainly for her colorful antics during the seventh-inning stretch. As the grounds crew swept the infield, Bonnie wielded her signature broom, sweeping off each base in turn. After sweeping third base, she would playfully swat the opposing team's third-base coach on the backside with her broom, following it up with a kiss on his cheek.

Bonnie was discontinued after the 1979 season, although no clear reason has ever been given for her ""firing"". Bernie Brewer was discontinued as a mascot in 1984, although he was brought back as a costumed mascot in 1993, complete with full-body costume and large foam head.

"Bacteria has spread rapidly to cover almost all of Utah Lake, turning the water bright green with a pea soup texture and leaving scummy foam along the shore

A huge toxic algae bloom in Utah has closed one of the largest freshwater lakes west of the Mississippi river, sickening more than 100 people and leaving farmers scrambling for clean water during some of the hottest days of the year.

The bacteria commonly known as blue-green algae has spread rapidly to cover almost all of 150-square-mile Utah Lake, turning the water bright, anti-freeze green with a pea soup texture and leaving scummy foam along the shore.

""It smells like something is rotting,"" said Jason Garrett, water quality director for the Utah County health department. ""We don't have an idea of how long this event will last.""

US west coast toxic algae bloom might be largest ever, say scientists Read more

Toxic algae is a problem around the country. An enormous outbreak in Florida is now fouling beaches on the east coast, and a 2014 outbreak at Lake Erie left more than 400,000 people in the Toledo area without tap water for two days.

Utah Lake doesn't provide drinking water, but its closure is causing big problems for people who use the lake for swimming, fishing and other activities, and for farmers with thirsty crops.

Utah poison control says it has fielded hundreds of calls related to the bloom, including 130 involving people who have reported vomiting, diarrhea, headache and rashes.

The contamination has now spread to the Jordan river, which supplies irrigation to dozens of farmers around Salt Lake City, about 45 miles north of the lake. The problem has occurred amid days of triple-digit temperatures as growers prepare for farmers markets and try to nurture crops such as corn and fruit trees at key points in their development.

""We've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this crop, maxed out every dollar we have,"" said Luke Petersen, who farms about 100 acres of tomatoes, summer squash and other produce in Riverton. ""We're real worried about it.""

Meanwhile, the Bonneville School of Sailing has had to cancel more than a dozen groups since the lake was closed.

""This will be a real hit,"" said co-owner Todd Frye. He loves the mountain-rimmed lake and has worked to change the decades-old perception that it's murky and polluted. New efforts to clean out bottom-feeding carp are improving the water quality, but he worries the algae bloom will be a blow to its image.

The lake is largely fed by treated wastewater as well as agricultural runoff, said Erica Gaddis, assistant director for the Utah division of water quality.

Longstanding drought conditions have made the water especially low and stagnant. Combine that with hot summer weather and Utah Lake became a perfect petri dish for the cyanobacteria.

There are chemical and biological treatments for the problem, but using them on such a large bloom would be unprecedented and possibly harmful, Gaddis said.

For now, authorities are waiting for the bloom to run its course and clear, hopefully aided by a drop in temperatures or a storm that could stir up the water and reduce stagnation.

One bit of good news is that early test results indicate levels of dangerous toxins produced by the bacteria may not be as high as feared, though the state is still waiting for more data.

To stave off new blooms in coming years, the state is looking to reduce the levels of toxic algae-feeding phosphorous and nitrogen in wastewater that's pumped into the lake. That could be difficult, however, because cities served by those plants include some of the fastest-growing in the nation.

""We've been loading the Utah Lake in one form or another for 150 years, and it's catching up with us,"" Gaddis said.",0
"Mathematics: The Universal Language for Solving Problems

Mathematics is perhaps one of the most essential subjects in the world. It is the universal language that helps us solve problems and understand the world around us. From calculating the distance between two planets to predicting the stock market trends, math plays a vital role in every aspect of our lives.

Mathematics has been around for centuries and has evolved to become a vast field of study, encompassing a wide range of topics such as algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics, and many more. Today, the applications of mathematics are limitless, and we see it being used in fields such as science, engineering, finance, and even art.

"Generative AI is revolutionizing the world of technology and is rapidly becoming one of the most exciting fields of research. This new technology is capable of creating complex and realistic images, videos, and text using machine learning algorithms.

Generative AI is a powerful tool that can be used to create new content that previously would have been impossible to create. For example, it can be used to create realistic images of objects that do not exist in the real world or generate new music and videos that sound like they were created by humans.

The technology behind generative AI is based on deep learning algorithms that use neural networks to learn from large datasets of images, videos, and text. These algorithms are trained to recognize patterns and generate new content based on those patterns.

The potential applications of generative AI are immense. For example, it can be used in the fashion industry to create new designs based on customer preferences, or in the gaming industry to create new characters and environments. It can also be used in the healthcare industry to create new drugs and treatments based on patient data.

However, generative AI also raises ethical concerns. For example, it can be used to create fake news and propaganda, or create realistic images of people who do not exist. There is also the potential for the technology to be used to create new forms of cyberbullying and harassment.

Despite these concerns, the potential of generative AI is too great to be ignored. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with this technology, we can expect to see even more exciting breakthroughs in the years to come.",1
"Can you drive snow and winter tires year round? It's an idea that occurs to many drivers who experience winter weather: If I have to mount snow tires every year, why don't I just keep them on my vehicle all the time?

Unfortunately, using snow tires year round isn't recommended. In the long run, it will cost more money than changing them out and could compromise your vehicle's performance on the road. That's why tire makers offer different types of tires for different seasons – the best option for you is determined by many factors including climate, driving style, and performance needs.

Here are some specific reasons why year-round use of winter tires is not advised. And if it's the hassle of tire mounting, unmounting, and remounting that you're tired of, we've included an idea for simplifying that process, too.

First, what is a Winter Tire?

All winter tires, whether studless or studded, are made to maintain better traction in extreme cold, and on icy, snowy, or slushy roads. The rubber is able to remain softer, which makes it more flexible, allowing the tire to conform to the road better in extremely cold conditions. This feature, along with deeper tread depths and specialized tread designs, are what make snow/winter tires ideal for inclement winter weather and extreme cold driving conditions.

We use this analogy - tennis shoes. Yes, you can wear tennis shoes on the beach or in the snow, but wouldn't it be better to have flip flops on the beach and boots for the snow? Winter tires are like snow boots for your car.

Why You Shouldn't Use Winter Tires Year-Round

Winter tires are specially designed for cold temperatures and winter precipitation. Once it gets warm, you won't need deep tread depths to handle snow or biting edges for traction on ice. Here are some specific reasons why using winter tires year round is not recommended.

Faster wear on warm, dry pavement - the tread rubber of winter tires is considerably more flexible than that of all season and summer tires. That same pliable tread rubber that adds traction in winter will wear down quickly in warm temperatures. Summer and all-season tires are built to withstand warm temperatures, providing long wear life.

Decreased performance - In warm weather, winter tires won't provide the same handling capabilities as summer or all-season tires. Imagine if you needed to make a quick maneuver and your tires were soft and squishy. You won't get the crisp response from a winter tire in warm weather. Winter tires need that flexibilitity to handle ice and snow, but it's not as useful in warm weather.

The specialized compounds and tread designs of winter tires are not designed for optimal warm climate performance and wear. Generally speaking, the softer tread of a winter tire will wear out faster in warmer temperatures. If you keep winter tires on your vehicle after winter has come and gone, you will have to replace them sooner than had you removed them for springtime.

That's why using snow tires year round is more expensive than mounting them seasonally. The sooner they wear out, the sooner you have to replace them.

Simplify Tire Re-Mounting

Driving on snow tires year-round could compromise optimal tread wear and ultimately be more expensive than just changing tires out for the season.

If you were considering year-round use of winter tires because you were tired of having to change them, here's an idea that could save you time and money. Purchase wheels with the same diameter and bolt pattern as your current wheels. Mount your snow tires on those and store them in the garage until winter arrives.

Instead of having to change out your tires each season, just have a technician change the wheels. It's a quick, relatively inexpensive alternative to mounting and unmounting snow tires every season.",0
"Ihsahn has been out with Emperor for a series of reunion shows this year and spoke with Noisey of the experience, among other things. One such topic was the changing perception of metal, of which Ihsahn offered the following take:

For us being here now against being there then, I guess our whole career is built on this kind of mystique almost. People didn't know shit about us. We were just crazy Norwegians from a place that most people hadn't heard of doing this extreme music in this strange makeup. [Laughs] So people had absolutely no clue. Whereas today you get in touch with the biggest stars on Twitter or Facebook or whatever. Nothing is private. It's very bad times to be kind of a mysterious black metal artist, I guess. It'd be very hard to build that kind of niche again if you were a young band starting out today. [Laughs]""

""I think particularly black metal has gone gray like many other metal subgenres or like music in general, really. You start out new as a phenomenon, and there gradually becomes different directions in that. Some people do something new, and then some people copy it, and it becomes watered down. It becomes gray. A lot of people involved in this genre originally do a lot of other interesting stuff. The genre itself has changed, but I think extreme music – it's more a matter of the whole music industry having changed. That's kind of the biggest thing if you take black metal now and then.

Those hoping the live reunion in support of the 20th anniversary of ""In The Nightside Eclipse"" would stoke some creative embers will be left in the cold though. When asked if new music or a full-fledged reunion was in the works, Ihsahn offered:


""Not at all. Not at all. I couldn't really see the point. I don't think that would be something that would feel natural and feel creative, and that's not meant to disrespect the other guys that I play with. But if you listen to the music that Samoth does now, there's quite a big difference between what he does and what I do. I think, musically, we can come together and perform the stuff that we did when those musical differences were constructive.

If it was up to me, Emperor now would sound like my solo stuff. Not that I would ever call it Emperor because then it wouldn't be that as it would be compromised. For me it would just be a different logo on the front because for me in the way I want to express myself in metal now, that's what I already do. To make an Emperor album, I'm sure financially speaking, it would be tempting.

It's a well-known brand, and you could probably do a lot of things promotion wise with it, but at the same time, it's the fact that we've maintained, and the fact that we've been uncompromising. I think both with Emperor and the stuff we've done outside of Emperor, I'm very conscious about that mutual agreement with my listeners who pick up my album and make this possible. I don't want to trick myself, and I don't want to screw them either. So every time I make an album I honestly try to do my absolute best, and I don't think I do my best if I start thinking about what would people want and what would people expect of me or this or that.

If we did that with Emperor or outside of Emperor, people would smell the dishonesty in that. It's not really an ego trip, either. Of course it is very egotistical and selfish of me in a very good way of just doing exactly what I want, but at the same time I think that is the most honest way of doing this. If people want to make music that people expect to have and what the market wants, that's kind of a different genre and a different industry. [Laughs]

People who want Emperor to get back together, I'm not sure if they know what they're asking for. What kind of Emperor album would it be? Would it be something we could honestly do in 2014 or 2015? It would be easy for us to make an album that sounded like something from back in the day in the vein of Eclipse or Anthems or whatever, but who would actually want that? It would be pointless, and in the end I think people respect it.

It's like when you get older and some people start wishing ""Oh, I wish I was young again."" It's not gonna happen, but it's a nice thought. But at the same time, if you were young again, you wouldn't want to experience all that crap all over again either way. [Laughs] It's kind of like that, and I honestly think that it creates a bit of trust between us as artists and the audience.""",0

Tottenham and Southampton are on alert after it emerged that Giannelli Imbula could be heading for an early Porto exit.

The Portuguese club held off competition from both Premier League sides as well as AC Milan to land Imbula for around £17.5m during the summer, ending one of the longest sagas of the window.

But, according to reports in France, Imbula is finding it hard to adapt to life at Porto.

He has struggled to impress in his first five league appearances and has been hauled off three times.

Now it has been suggested that he is already planning to quit Porto.

AC Milan, desperate to land him last month, could be back in for him, while Saints and Spurs to try their luck at signing him again, too – and they could move as early as January.",0
"Mathematics: The Building Blocks of Modern Society

Mathematics is often regarded as a daunting subject for many people, but it is an essential component of modern society. Everything from the technology we use to the financial decisions we make relies on mathematics. In the simplest of terms, mathematics is the study of numbers and their relationships, and it plays a crucial role in almost all aspects of our lives.

Firstly, mathematics is an integral part of science and technology. Without it, we would not have the advancements we have today. It is the foundation for engineering, computer science, physics, and many other sciences. The field of data analytics, which is rapidly growing in popularity, relies on mathematical models to predict trends, analyze patterns and make decisions based on data.

Additionally, mathematics is a critical component of finance and economics. From balancing a checkbook to analyzing stock market trends, numbers and calculations play a vital role in making informed decisions. The field of actuarial science helps insurance companies determine premiums by using mathematical models to predict risk and loss.

Moreover, mathematics is also essential in everyday life. It helps us understand and solve problems in areas such as cooking, construction, and even sports. Measuring ingredients in recipes, determining the amount of material needed for a building project, and calculating scores in sports competitions all involve mathematical concepts.

In conclusion, mathematics is a fundamental subject that is critical to our modern society. It is not just an academic discipline but a practical tool that we use in our daily lives. It is the foundation for many fields and the key to unlocking many of the mysteries of the world around us. As such, we cannot underestimate its importance, and we must continue to invest in its study and development.",1
"Despite being the backbone of every economy, small and medium-sized businesses have traditionally faced challenges in securing access to short-term financing from traditional lenders. To resolve this issue, the Hive Project today announced the development of a cryptocurrency invoice financing platform to help SMEs overcome the hurdles they face when trying to get the financing they need.

The new platform is focused on providing new liquidity pools for small and medium-sized businesses which are often challenged by the levels of collateral required and the strict credit checks put in place by lenders.

Join the Leading Industry Event!

The Hive Project's end-to-end platform aims to use blockchain to disrupt the SME finance space, using distributed ledger technology to offer SMEs easy access to short-term financing by turning their accounts receivables into tradable assets.

Powered by the risk-lowering technology offered by blockchain, the platform generates smart contracts and creates a digital marketplace through which small businesses can finance their unpaid invoices.

Suggested articles B2Broker's Arthur Azizov: 'Finteсh Startups Do Not Need to Reinvent the Wheel'Go to article >>

With its prospects lying in its simplicity, this innovation will give companies the option to sell their invoices to improve their working capital, offering a full marketplace with advanced trading analytics for peer-to-peer lending.

On top of that, the company plans to raise initial capital of BTC 2,000 through its token (HVN) crowdsale scheduled for six weeks starting July 3, 2017. The monies will be allocated for technical infrastructure development and the creation of the Hive Invoice Financing Fund (HVNX), which will be a welcome solution to this growing demand for credit.

Jure Soklic, CEO and co-founder of the Hive Project, commented: ""We want to help small businesses solve their liquidity issues by leveraging blockchain technology to provide financing options previously only available to large companies. Our platform will dramatically streamline invoice issuance and settlement processes, optimizing small and medium-enterprises' ability to access liquidity for day-to-day operations and to finance expansion.""

Richard Titus, Advisor to Hive Project and Former SVP Samsung Electronics Visual Display, added: ""The Hive Project helps small businesses automate invoicing and payments, delivering the benefits of blockchain innovation to commercial entities previously deprived of ready access to finances,"" said ""Hive Project's end state, a marketplace with advanced trading analytics for peer-to-peer lending, will rapidly increase the liquidity available to small businesses and expand today's often mercenary ecosystem of factoring and lending.""",0
"The latest release of Australian unemployment data has largely caught economists, and by extension the market, sharply by surprise.

In fact, rather than coming in at the forecasted 5.9% the unemployment rate actually declined to 5.7% in April. Subsequently, the labor market appears to be going through resurgence but just how robust the current gains are remains to be seen, Economic Calendar reported.

The employment change figures for April showed a gain of around 37.4k jobs, which followed on from a rise of 60k in March. Obviously, this is a welcome strengthening of the labor market and should lead to some inflationary gains over the medium term. However, the headline rate was a little less impressive with full time positions declining by nearly 11.6k in April. Subsequently, the rise in part-time employment is a relatively concerning trend in the Australian economy.

In fact, the total hours worked metric declined by around 0.3% whilst part time employment has risen by over 111,300 positions in the past year. This all highlights the underlying reasons why the unemployment rate and job gain figures can be somewhat misleading. It also goes some of the way to explaining why there has been little in the way of systemic inflation over the past year, despite some strong gains in the employment numbers.

However, despite the employment figures being somewhat unreliable as a macroeconomic indicator, the results are likely to be noticed by the Reserve Bank of Australia. In fact, there is a view that the recent gains may actually see the central bank delaying a potential cut to interest rates given the risk of inflationary pressures arriving down the line.

Subsequently, the next RBA meeting is likely to see the central bank holding rates at 1.50% for the tenth consecutive meeting. Lending further support to this view is the increasing domestic debt levels, largely to do with the housing bubble, that the central bank are very clearly concerned with. Subsequently, cutting rates further, and by extension, providing a looser credit environment is likely to not be particularly high on the RBA's agenda.

Ultimately, although the falling unemployment rate is likely to be relatively welcome news to the Australian public, It hides deeper issues around the appropriateness of part time employment and what impact this will have on inflation in the medium term.",0

"The educational system of Finland: A model for success

Finland, a small country in Northern Europe, has long been lauded for its innovative educational system. The Finnish approach, which prioritizes equal access to education and a focus on student well-being, has consistently ranked among the top in the world. Here is a look at some of the key features of the Finnish educational system and why it has been so successful.

Equal access to education:

In Finland, education is considered a fundamental right for all citizens. As a result, access to high-quality education is available to everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic background. This approach has helped to reduce the achievement gap between students from different social and economic backgrounds, ensuring that every student has an equal opportunity to succeed.

Student-centered learning:

The Finnish education system prioritizes individualized learning, with a focus on student well-being and academic success. The curriculum is designed to allow for flexibility and creativity, with teachers encouraged to tailor their lessons to the needs and interests of their students. This approach helps to foster a love of learning, as students are given the opportunity to explore their passions and interests.

Highly trained teachers:

In Finland, teaching is considered a highly respected profession, with rigorous training and high standards for teachers. All teachers are required to hold a master's degree, and the selection process for teacher training programs is highly competitive. This emphasis on teacher quality has resulted in excellent educational outcomes.

Collaboration over competition:

Unlike many countries, Finland places little emphasis on standardized testing or ranking schools. Instead, the focus is on collaboration and cooperation between students, teachers, and schools. This approach encourages creativity and problem-solving skills, as students learn to work together in a supportive and inclusive environment.

Conclusion:

The Finnish educational system has become a model for success, with its focus on equal access to education, student-centered learning, highly trained teachers, and collaboration. Its emphasis on individualized learning and student well-being has resulted in one of the most successful education systems in the world, with consistently high academic achievement scores and low levels of inequality. Other countries can learn from Finland's approach to education, and work towards creating a system that prioritizes the needs and interests of students, while also promoting academic excellence.",1
"Tragedy Strikes: Fatal Accident Claims Three Lives

In the early hours of the morning, tragedy struck as a fatal accident claimed the lives of three individuals. The accident occurred on the busy intersection of Main Street and Fifth Avenue, causing chaos and devastation in its wake.

Eyewitnesses reported a speeding car colliding with a truck, causing both vehicles to spin out of control and collide with two other cars that were waiting at the intersection. The force of the impact was so severe that the cars were mangled beyond recognition, and emergency responders had to use cutting tools to extricate the victims from the wreckage.

Sadly, three individuals lost their lives in the accident, including the driver of the speeding car and two passengers in one of the other vehicles. The driver of the truck involved in the accident sustained minor injuries and was rushed to the hospital for treatment.

The identities of the victims have not yet been released, and investigations into the accident are ongoing. The police have stated that they are looking into the possibility of reckless driving and speeding as contributing factors to the accident.

The accident caused major disruptions to traffic in the area, with several roads being closed off for several hours as the wreckage was cleared and investigations conducted. The authorities have urged motorists to exercise caution and obey traffic rules to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.

This tragic accident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of safe driving practices and the devastating consequences that can result from careless behavior on the road. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims during this difficult time.",1
"60 Reasons Why the Bible Is Not A Perfect Text Written by Joe Pettit Keep in mind that I am trying to persuade a reader of this list that the Bible is not the inerrant and literal words of God. I am not trying to prove such a conclusion. The clever, although usually very implausible, use of verbal and historical gymnastics can probably get around most of the problems on this list. However, such acts of contextual and verbal contortion are always far less persuasive than the simple and single conclusion that the Bible is a human text that is responding to God in often profound, but also inconsistent, contrary, and necessarily flawed ways. Note: Most of what follows is a discussion of New Testament texts. I simply have not studied the Jewish scriptures as much as I have Christian texts. Also, some of the problems may seem insignificant, and they probably are, but the point is that even insignificant problems should never appear in a text that is literally and inerrantly from God; that is, they should not appear in a perfect text, whereas their presence in profound but flawed human texts is easy to explain. If, after reading this, you wonder what it is that I actually believe as one who calls himself a Christian, I have tried to make that clearer here [Sources: Most of the following is heavily dependent on Bart Ehrman's The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings, 3rd edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004, and on Ehrman's Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why. New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 2005] Textual Problems Often, the texts of the Bible themselves are difficult, and likely impossible, to reconcile to each other. This is easy to explain if they were written by many different fallible people at many different times and places. It is very difficult to explain if the texts are from God. 1. The Order of Creation: In the first chapter of Genesis, animals are created before humans (1:20-24, 1:26-27), but in the second chapter, man is created before the animals (2:7, 2:19). 2. The Iniquity of the Father: In Exodus 34:7 we are told that the iniquity of the father will be visited upon the children and upon their children ""unto the fourth generation."" But in Ezekiel 18:20 we are told that ""the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father."" Moreover, Ezekiel explicitly repudiates the Exodus interpretation. 3. Noah and the Flood: Upon careful examination, it becomes clear that there are two stories of Noah and the flood and that these stories have some rather significant differences. Most of us are familiar with the version that has Noah bringing one pair of every animal on to the Ark (7:8-15), where it rained for 40 days and forty nights (7:4, 8:6), and that after 54 days (two weeks after the 40 days were over) the waters had receded enough that the dove released by Noah did not return. However, there is another version of the story where Noah takes seven pairs of every ""clean"" beast (7:2) and only one pair of every unclean beast; where it first rains for 150 days, and then takes another 150 days (10 months from the start of the flood) for the first mountain tops to appear. Also, rather strangely, Noah and his family enter the Ark twice; once at 7:7 and then again at 7:13. There is a fine demonstration of how the two different versions of the Noah story are woven together at http://www.energion.com/rpp/flood.shtml . There is one additional problem with the Noah story. It is almost identical to another flood story told in the Epic of Gilgamesh, a text much older than the account of Noah. In the Epic we read of a man warned by a god to build a boat because another god who is tired of the noise of humanity is going to destroy every human being. After the man's boat comes to rest on a mountain, he releases a bird three times (just like Noah), only he first releases a dove, then a sparrow, and then a raven (Noah actually releases a raven as well at 8:7, we just never hear or read about it). The man sacrifices on a mountain to the god who saved him, just like Noah. It is difficult to avoid concluding that the authors of the Noah stories were ""influenced"" by the Epic of Gilgamesh. 4. Many Languages, or One? In chapter 10 of Genesis, we get a long account of the many peoples and many languages that descend from Noah and of the many lands that they occupied (10:5, 20, 31-32). However, after this, we are told in the set up for the Tower of Babel story that whole land had only one language and that they all managed to settle on only one plain",0
"Generative AI: The Future of Creative Technology

Artificial Intelligence has come a long way since its inception. From automating mundane tasks to performing complex calculations, AI has revolutionized the way we interact with technology. However, the latest breakthrough in AI is Generative AI, a technology that has the potential to change the creative landscape as we know it.

Generative AI is a subset of AI that focuses on generating new and unique content, such as images, music, and text, based on a set of predefined parameters. It operates on a principle of machine learning, where the AI is trained on a large dataset and then generates new content based on the patterns it has learned. With the ability to create original content, Generative AI has the potential to transform industries like art, music, and advertising.

One of the most exciting applications of Generative AI is in the field of visual art. Using Generative AI, artists can create entirely new and unique artworks that are impossible to replicate. This technology offers an exciting opportunity for artists to experiment with new styles and techniques, without the limitations of traditional mediums. Additionally, Generative AI can also be used to create personalized art, where the AI generates artwork based on the user's preferences and interests.

In the music industry, Generative AI has already made significant strides. With the ability to create entirely new music, AI-generated music has the potential to revolutionize the way we experience music. In fact, AI-generated music is already being used by some music production companies to create unique soundscapes for films and advertisements.

Moreover, Generative AI can also be used in the field of advertising. With the ability to create personalized content, advertisers can create more targeted and effective ads. This technology is already being used by some companies to create personalized ad campaigns that are tailored to the individual user's interests and preferences.

Despite its potential benefits, Generative AI also raises ethical concerns. For instance, the technology can be used to create deepfakes, which can lead to misinformation and propaganda. It is, therefore, crucial to regulate the use of Generative AI and ensure it is used ethically.

In conclusion, Generative AI is a groundbreaking technology that has the potential to revolutionize the creative landscape. From creating original artworks to generating entirely new music, the possibilities are endless. However, as with any new technology, it is crucial to ensure that it is used ethically and responsibly.",1

"Washington D.C. - Prominent politician Senator John Smith (D-CA) has been making waves on Capitol Hill with his recent bold proposals.

Senator Smith, who has been in the Senate for over a decade, has been known to be a vocal advocate for healthcare reform and protecting the environment. However, his recent proposals have garnered attention and controversy.

One of his proposals calls for a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax system, which he believes is unfair and burdensome for middle-class Americans. The plan would eliminate many tax breaks and loopholes that benefit the wealthy and large corporations, while providing more relief for working-class families.

Another proposal that has caused a stir is his call for increased regulation of the tech industry. Senator Smith believes that tech companies have become too powerful and that their unregulated practices have caused harm to consumers and society as a whole.

These proposals have received mixed reactions from fellow lawmakers and the public. Some praise Senator Smith for his boldness and willingness to tackle tough issues, while others criticize him for proposing policies that could hurt businesses and the economy.

Despite the controversy, Senator Smith remains steadfast in his beliefs and continues to push for change. His passion and dedication have won him many supporters, and he remains a prominent figure in the political landscape.

In an interview with the press, Senator Smith stated, ""I believe that it is our duty as public servants to fight for the common good, even if it means taking on powerful interests. I will continue to work tirelessly to make our country a better place for all Americans.""

With Senator Smith's proposals making waves in Congress, it remains to be seen how they will ultimately be received and if they will become a reality. However, one thing is clear - Senator Smith is not afraid to speak his mind and fight for what he believes in.",1

"Scientists Make Breakthrough Discovery in Cancer Research

In a groundbreaking new study, scientists have discovered a promising new approach to treating cancer. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have found that a combination of two drugs, nivolumab and ipilimumab, can effectively shrink tumors in patients with advanced melanoma. The study, which was published in the journal Nature, has drawn widespread attention and offers hope to millions of people around the world who are affected by cancer.

The two drugs work by activating the body's immune system to attack cancer cells. Nivolumab is a checkpoint inhibitor, which means it blocks a protein called PD-1 that can prevent immune cells from identifying and attacking cancer cells. Ipilimumab, on the other hand, is a type of antibody that targets a protein called CTLA-4, which also plays a role in suppressing the immune system. By combining the two drugs, researchers were able to overcome some of the resistance that cancer cells can develop to one",1
"AFP/Madrid

Spain and Portugal are grappling with a devastating drought which has left rivers nearly dry, sparked deadly wildfires and devastated crops -- and experts warn that prolonged dry spells will become more frequent.

The national weather office says 94 percent of Portugal is enduring what it classifies as an 'extreme' drought.

'The country has never experienced a drought like this in the sense that it worsened significantly in October, a time of the year when the situation normally improves,' a climatologist with the weather office, Fatima Espirito Santo, told AFP.

Two-thirds of Spain has received considerably less rain during the last three years than it normally does.

'It's a ruinous situation,' said Jose Ramon Gonzalez, a small rancher in Spain's normally rainy northwestern region of Galicia.

Due to the scarcity of grass, Gonzalez was forced to spend thousands of euros to buy fodder for his cattle in July, four months earlier than normal.

'There are rivers, springs, which neither I, at the age of 45, nor my parents, nor my grandparents, have seen dry which have dried up,' he said.

About 1.38 million hectares (3.4 million acres) of grains, sunflowers and olive trees have been affected by drought or frost in Spain as of the end of October, according to Spanish farming insurance agency Agroseguro.

It has dished out more than 200 million euros ($236 million) in compensation this year.

'You feel helpless like when you are sick, you can't do anything. This sickness is called drought,' said Vicente Ortiz, a farmer and rancher in Spain's central Castilla-La Mancha region, whose endless plain is depicted in 'Don Quixote', the famous work by Miguel de Cervantes.

Ortiz said his grain harvest has plunged 70 percent from last year and he expects to harvest half as many olives.

The situation is just as dire for farmers across the border in neighbouring Portugal.

'All crops are suffering from this lack of water in our region, from olives to grains and grapes,' said Fremelinda Carvalho, the president of the association of farmers on Portalegre in central Portugal.

The dry fields and forests have fuelled wildfires, which killed 109 people this year in Portugal and five in Galicia, many dying in their cars as they tried to flee the flames.

- Water conflicts -

Water reservoirs are at abnormally low levels.

In Portugal 28 of the country's water reservoirs in October were at less than 40 percent of their storage capacity.

This weekend about a hundred fire trucks began transporting water from one dam in northern Portugal to another that is running dry and supplies water to Viseu, a city of around 100,000 residents.

In Spain the water reservoirs along the Tagus River, which empty into the Atlantic near Lisbon, were as of Monday at just 39.3 percent of their capacity.

The levels were even lower in the Douro River further north and the Segura River, which is used to irrigate crops in southeastern Spain.

Spain's largest power company, Iberdrola, saw its hydroelectric power production plunge 58 percent during the first nine months of the year, compared to the same period last year, pushing up electricity prices.

The drought is also fuelling conflicts among regions over the use of water.

One source of tension is a massive aqueduct built in the 1960s during the Spanish dictatorship of Francisco Franco to siphon off water from the Tagus River to the smaller Segura River.

The Tagus River 'can not support' this aqueduct, said Antonio Luengo, head of the agency that regulates water in Spain's Castilla-La Mancha region.

The water diverted from the Tagus had been used to massively develop fruit and vegetable farms in southeastern Spain and now water from the Mediterranean must be desalinated to support these crops, he said.

- Climate risks -

Experts warn that droughts are likely to become more frequent and severe in the region.

'Spain has since 1980 shown signs of climate change, which have increased since 2000,' said Jorge Olcina, who heads the University of Alicante's climate institute.

The country's climate 'tends to have more subtropical characteristics. Higher temperatures and rarer and more intense rains. So climate-related risks -- heatwaves and rain and droughts and floods, will increase in the coming decades,' he added.

Spain has managed water 'very badly', said Julio Barea, spokesman for the Spanish branch of Greenpeace.

He cited as examples the use of water to irrigate trees that do not normally need much water, such as olive and almond trees, and the planting of water-intensive crops that are not suited to Spain",0

"Generative AI: A New Frontier in Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence has come a long way since its inception, with advancements in machine learning and deep learning leading to breakthroughs in various fields. One of the latest developments in AI is generative AI, which has the potential to revolutionize the way we create and produce content.

What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a subset of machine learning that focuses on creating new content, such as images, videos, music, and even text, using algorithms and neural networks. Unlike traditional machine learning, which learns from existing data to make predictions, generative AI generates new data from scratch based on the patterns it has learned.

How Does It Work?

Generative AI uses complex mathematical models known as generative models, which are trained on large datasets of existing content. These models then learn the patterns and features of the data and use them to generate new content that is similar in style and quality.

For example, a generative AI model trained on images of flowers can generate new images of flowers that are not identical to any of the original images but are similar in style, color, and composition.

Applications of Generative AI

Generative AI has numerous applications in various fields, including art, design, music, and advertising. For example, generative AI can be used to generate personalized ads based on users' preferences and behavior. It can also be used to create original music compositions and artwork.

In the gaming industry, generative AI can be used to create new game levels and characters in real-time, providing gamers with a more immersive gaming experience.

Another concern is the potential for misuse, as generative AI can be used to create fake content, such as deepfakes, which can be used to spread misinformation and harm individuals and organizations.

Conclusion

Generative AI is a fascinating and rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence that has the potential to revolutionize the way we create and produce content. While it poses several challenges and ethical concerns, if developed and used responsibly, it has the potential to bring about significant positive changes in various industries.",1
"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we create, produce, and consume content. From video game design to music composition, generative AI can be used to create a wide range of content with minimal human input.

Generative AI refers to the use of machine learning algorithms to create content that is original, creative, and sometimes even unpredictable. It works by analyzing vast amounts of data and using this information to create new content that is similar in style or theme to the original dataset.

One of the most exciting applications of generative AI is in video game design. Developers can use generative AI to create entire game worlds and environments that are unique and dynamic. This can lead to an immersive gaming experience that is different each time a player logs in.

Another area where generative AI is being used is in music composition. AI algorithms can analyze a musician's style of music and create new compositions based on that style. This can lead to new and unique sounds that have never been heard before.

Generative AI is also being used in the fashion industry. Clothing designers can use generative AI to create new clothing designs that are tailored to individual customers' preferences. This allows designers to create clothing that is unique and personalized to each customer's tastes.

However, there are some concerns surrounding the use of generative AI. Critics argue that it could lead to job losses in creative industries such as music and fashion design. Additionally, there are worries about the potential for AI-generated content to be used for malicious purposes, such as the creation of fake news articles or deepfake videos.

Despite these concerns, generative AI is an exciting and rapidly developing field that has the potential to change the way we create and consume content. As technology continues to advance, it will be interesting to see how generative AI evolves and what new applications it can be used for.",1
"If the defense for No. 6 Stanford thought going against Oregon and its high scoring offense wasn't daunting enough, consider this: The Cardinal on Tuesday learned team captain and all-conference defensive end Ben Gardner will be lost for the season with a torn left pectoral.

Coach David Shaw announced the injury on Tuesday and said Gardner will undergo surgery on Thursday. No. 2 Oregon (8-0 overall, 5-0 Pac-12) plays at No. 6 Stanford (7-1, 5-1) next Thursday, Nov. 7, in a game that will go a long way in determining the Pac-12 North champion.

Gardner suffered the injury in the third quarter of last week's game at Oregon State. He was second on the Cardinal in sacks (4.5) and tackles for loss (7.5) and was second-team all conference for the past two seasons.

Stanford's other defensive end -- Henry Anderson -- is trying to come back from a knee injury suffered in September. Shaw said he is unsure whether Anderson will be ready for the Nov. 7 game in Palo Alto, Calif.

Stanford has also played the past two games without injured kicker Jordan Williamson, and his replacement -- Conrad Ukropina -- has gone 1-for-2 on field goals and last week missed an extra point.

"Jesse Morton made national headlines when he was accused in federal court of using his Revolution Muslim website to encourage attacks against the creators of ""South Park"" and others he said were enemies of Islam.

After he was convicted, the Virginia man became an FBI informant. Once released from prison, he joined a D.C.-area think tank focused on studying extremism, saying he hoped to ""make amends"" through his work.

But Morton, now 38, again faces legal troubles after being arrested and accused of bringing cocaine to meet a prostitute. He is due in court next week and could return to prison.

Morton is no longer working as a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, a spokesman confirmed.

Morton was once deemed by federal prosecutors as dangerous to ""the very freedoms on which our society is based."" But even before leaving prison, he has said in an interview, he began working undercover on counterterrorism operations. He was released in 2015 after serving less than a third of his 11½ -year prison sentence and hired by GWU the following year.

According to court documents, Morton was arrested on Dec. 28 in a sting operation by Fairfax police. He answered an ad on Backpage.com for a prostitute, police said. When he showed up at the Governor House Inn & Suites in Falls Church, he was arrested. Police say they found cocaine and a glass pipe in his pack of Marlboro cigarettes. In his car, they said they found another device for smoking crack cocaine. He is charged with possession with manufacturing a controlled substance and residing in a bawdy place.

[The feds billed him as a threat to American freedom. Now they're paying him for help.]

Morton could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer did not return a request for comment. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Alexandria on Tuesday and in Fairfax County court on April 19.

Morton's violent exhortations on the Revolution Muslim website were blamed for inspiring Colleen LaRose, who tried to kill a Swedish cartoonist, and Jose Pimentel, who plotted a New York City bombing, among others. Morton pleaded guilty in 2012 to conspiring to solicit murder, making threatening communications and using the Internet to place others in fear.

In an interview last fall with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Morton said that after his plea and while in prison, he began doing work for federal agents. According to court documents and a defense attorney involved, after his release Morton was paid by the FBI to help build a case against a supporter of the Islamic State.

[George Washington University hires a former al-Qaeda recruiter]

The FBI also relied on Morton to help demystify the radicalization process, and he took on a similar role at GWU.

In a 2016 interview with The Washington Post, Morton said he hoped that work would give him ""a bit of an ability to make amends.""

He explained how what he described as a traumatic childhood and substance abuse issues left him alienated, searching for a personal transformation and a countercultural worldview. He said he found it first by reading ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X"" during a brief jail stint at age 20. During a second incarceration, Morton converted to Islam.

A fellow prisoner told him a war was coming between Muslims and non-Muslims, and he took up that cause, he told CSIS, fusing extremist politics to his new religious fervor. After his release, even as he graduated from Metropolitan College of New York and earned a master's degree in international affairs from Columbia University in 2008, Morton associated with violent ideologues and became one himself.

Before his arrest in the federal case, Morton told CSIS, he had begun questioning his views. The way he was treated by agents, he said, made him start to see the good in the U.S. justice system.",0

"Story highlights Several countries have disputed Falklands ownership since first recorded landfall in17th century

Islands have been coveted as strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of resources

Argentina and Britain fought over the islands in 1982

More recently, the Argentinians have accused the British of blatant colonialism

Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has again opened the dispute over sovereignty of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic, accusing the British government of blatant colonialism.

Known to the Argentinians as Las Malvinas, the two countries went to war over the territory in 1982 after the then military government in Argentina landed troops on the islands.

In an open letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron and published in British newspapers Thursday, the Argentinian leader said ""Britain, the colonial power, has refused to return the territories to the Argentine Republic, thus preventing it from restoring its territorial integrity.""

The British government was swift to respond, insisting that there would be no discussions over sovereignty ""unless and until such as the time as the islanders so wish.""

It is the latest in a recent series of incidents that has raised tensions between the two countries.

What led to the latest dispute?

"Glass et al. (1989) reported a 16-year-old boy with severe mental retardation, microcephaly, and craniofacial dysmorphism associated with an interstitial deletion of chromosome 2q32.2-q33.1. He had no comprehensible speech and was totally dependent for all activities. Facial features included large beaked nose, ptosis, and cleft palate. He also had seizures and a striking scalloped skin pigmentation that did not follow Blaschko lines. Activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1; 147700) was normal.

Van Buggenhout et al. (2005) reported 4 unrelated patients with interstitial deletions of chromosome 2q32-q33. Common clinical features included pre- and postnatal growth retardation, severe mental retardation, thin and sparse hair, persistent feeding difficulties, inguinal hernia, and broad-based gait. Facial features included high long face, high forehead, ptosis, dacrocystitis, high nasal bridge, small mouth, teeth abnormalities, micrognathia, and cleft or high-arched palate. Two patients had seizures, and 3 had spasticity and contractures. Three patients had a specific behavioral phenotype with hyperactivity and motor restlessness, chaotic behavior, and happy personality intermixed with periods of aggression and anxiety, sleeping problems and self-mutilation. Array CGH and FISH analysis showed that all patients shared an 8.1-Mb minimal deleted region. The cleft or high-arched palate most likely resulted from hemizygosity for the SATB2 gene (608148).

Rosenfeld et al. (2009) reported 3 unrelated patients with small heterozygous deletions of chromosome 2q33.1, ranging from 173.1 to 185.2 kb, that affected only the SATB2 gene. Parental samples from the mother were available for only 2 patients, and neither mother carried the deletion; parental samples were not available for the third patient. All patients had severe developmental delay, mental retardation, and tooth anomalies, but other features varied. Dentofacial anomalies included delayed primary dentition and micrognathia in 1 patient; cleft palate, crowded teeth, and small mandible in the second; and fused mandibular central incisors without cleft palate in the third. Two patients had behavioral abnormalities and mild dysmorphic features. Rosenfeld et al. (2009) concluded that haploinsufficiency for SATB2 is responsible for some of the clinical features associated with the 2q32-q33 deletion syndrome.

Urquhart et al. (2009) reported a girl with a de novo heterozygous 4.5-Mb microdeletion of chromosome 2q33.1. She had cleft soft palate, feeding problems, febrile seizures, and delayed psychomotor development with poor speech. She was mildly dysmorphic, with broad forehead, flat philtrum, small mouth, thin upper lip, missing lateral incisors, and relative macrocephaly, but ears were normal. She also had joint laxity, valgus foot deformity, broad toes and thumbs, brachydactyly, and contractures of the fourth and fifth fingers. She had a social disposition. Brain MRI showed nonspecific periventricular white matter abnormalities. The deleted region included the SATB2 gene.

Rifai et al. (2010) reported a 16-year-old girl, born of unrelated French Caribbean parents, with an interstitial 26.3-Mb deletion of chromosome 2q31.2-q33.2. She had prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, cleft palate, camptodactyly, bilateral talipes equinovarus, severe intellectual disability, and ectodermal anomalies. Ectodermal anomalies included thin, atrophic skin, sparse, brittle, slowly growing hair, oligodontia with abnormally shaped teeth, normal sweating, and normal fingernails. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of ectodermal dysplasia. The deletion resulted in hemizygosity for the HOXD gene (see, e.g., HOXD1; 142987) cluster and its regulatory elements, which may affect limb development. Haploinsufficiency of other genes such as COL3A1 (120180)/COL5A2 (120190), GTF3C3 (604888), CASP8 (601763), CASP10 (601762), and SATB2 may also influence the phenotype.

"Canadian Grand Prix cancelled for 2004: official

Updated

The 2004 Canadian Formula One Grand Prix has been officially cancelled because of the Federal Government's ban on tobacco-related sponsorship, F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone said.

This is the first time the Formula One Management Company confirmed information from Canadian Grand Prix officials that the event would not take place next year.

""I can confirm though that a letter was written to the Canadian race promoter following a meeting I had with him when I informed him the Canadian round of the FIA Formula One World Championship would not be included in the 2004 calendar,"" Ecclestone said in a statement posted on the F1 website.

""The reason for this is that the Canadian Government has brought into effect a total prohibition on tobacco-related sponsorship.

""There is a provision in our contract with the race promoter that should this become effective, we have the right not to include their event in the calendar for the relevant year.""

Canada had held a Formula One race since 1967 and Montreal has hosted the race since 1978 on an circuit named after the late Gilles Villeneuve, father of 1997 world champion and hometown favourite Jacques Villeneuve.

The event, one of the city's biggest tourist attractions with an estimated windfall of more than C$50 million ($US36 million), packs over 100.000 fans around the circuit and is one of the few races to draw sell-out crowds.

The Belgian Grand Prix at Spa, widely viewed as the world's ultimate racing venue for its countryside surroundings and technical difficulty, was cancelled this season because of similar legislation.

A leading Belgian politician said this week the race would be on again next year after a ban on tobacco advertising was postponed.

""Our problem is quite simple. The Formula One teams with tobacco-related sponsorship lose part of their revenue when a certain percentage of the events ban tobacco sponsorship. This was the reason the Belgium Grand Prix was not included in the 2003 calendar,"" Ecclestone said.

The A1 Ring in Austria also bade farewell to Formula One this year as Ecclestone last month terminated his contract for next season due to the country's backing of EU legislation against tobacco advertising, which takes effect in 2005.

Unfortunately, mathematics is often viewed as a subject that is only for “smart” people. This stereotype can discourage students from pursuing math and limit their potential career options. However, it is important to remember that mathematics is not about innate talent, but rather effort and perseverance. With practice and dedication, anyone can master math.

To promote the importance of mathematics, many initiatives have been launched worldwide. In the United States, the National Math and Science Initiative works to improve students’ math and science skills by providing training and resources to teachers. In India, the Srinivasa Ramanujan International Mathematical Talent Search Exam encourages students to develop their math abilities and compete at an international level.

In conclusion, mathematics is a subject of great significance that should be embraced by all. Its practical applications and intellectual benefits make it an essential tool for everyday life. By promoting the value of mathematics",1
"If I had a dime for every time I've seen or heard a Jazz fan complain about the Jazz passing on Paul George in the 2010 draft, I would be able to pay for a lower bowl seat to a Jazz game. I think the clamor from Jazz fans has been for a few reasons:

1. It's easy to love a player that you only see highlights of and harder to love your own player who you watch 3 times a week, warts and all.

2. Paul George was just named to the All-Star team. I mean, he's an All-star. Hayward is a 6th man.

3. Gordon Hayward can't do this:


I am the president of the ""circumstance over talent"" club, which is a club I just made up comprised of NBA fans who see the difference between a player who is truly better at basketball and a player who just has a better opportunity to put up numbers or succeed. And with Gordon Hayward and Paul George, I think most Jazz fans believe George is a little or much better than Hayward, but I am not so convinced.

Before I show you some numbers, i must explain that I am not a huge fan of the way Per-36 minutes numbers are often used. If you are using them to show why a guy who plays 12 minutes and scores 8 points would average 24 points if given 36 minutes, that is probably a misuse of the stat. But if you are trying to standardize stats for two different players who play different amounts of minutes, but both play close to 36 minutes against top competition for most of the game, I think it's a useful tool. With that in mind, here are the Per 36 minute numbers for Hayward and George.

Which player is better? The top player is a significantly better rebounder and slightly better assist getter. But the bottom player is better in almost every other category. More points, less turnovers, better shooting from the field, the 3 point line and the free throw line. And the bottom player gets to the free throw line at a much better rate. The bottom player is Gordon Hayward and the top player is Paul George. To me, the big difference is that George is a much better rebounder and plays 11 more minutes per game. Other than that, Hayward is better at almost everything.

Paul George

Gordon Hayward

There are a couple things I think are important to this data. First, look at how Hayward's usage percentage has steadily climbed during his career. Part of this is due to is coming off the bench, but he actually has the ball in his hands as much as Paul George does, almost to the decimal point. And the fact that Hayward has increased his usage by a large amount, AND has cut his turnovers down, is super encouraging.

Secondly, I think every Jazz fan has lamented Hayward's turnover problems, but he actually turns the ball at a lower rate than George does. In fact if you look at synergy, which is a pretty good way to document the way a player uses offensive possessions, you will see that Hayward is really George's equal.

Hayward averages 0.94 points per possession to George's 0.9. George is a slightly better isolation scorer, but when both are put in pick n roll situations, George turns the ball over 22.5% of the time to Hayward's 24% of the time. So while there is a ton of room for improvement for Hayward on pick n rolls, he isn't lagging far behind George, although both are significantly behind contemporaries like John Wall, Evan Turner or even Kyrie Irving, players who use up to 30% of their possessions in pick n roll situations, while keeping their turnover percentages down around 17%. But Turner has several of his own limitations and Irving might be the best player in the NBA in 6 years.

So the next time you hear a Jazz fan lament at the fact that the Jazz drafted Gordon Hayward instead of Paul George, just tell them that Hayward is as productive as George is, if not even more.",0
"Machine Learning: The Future of Technology

Machine learning is a rapidly growing field in the world of technology. It is a subset of artificial intelligence, which focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. Essentially, it is a type of computer-based learning that allows machines to learn from experience and improve their performance over time.

This is one of those ""accessible"" piracy history books in the vein of David Cordingly, Colin Woodard, Marcus Rediker. And it has the same kind of problems as those books. Namely, it can be a little deceptive/suspicious. First of all, I absolutely cannot stand this format of footnotes, where they are not numbered in the text, just like in Woodard's Republic of Pirates. I understand most people probably don't read footnotes, but I do, and it sure gets on my nerves when I go fact-checking in the footnotes and see that a claim is not even LISTED, much less sourced. That makes it very hard for me to trust any information presented to me. So that being said, this book does a much better job when it is working off real evidence--which is to say, the parts of the book about the government officials and politicians, who left enough of a historical paper trail to substantiate Burgess' writing. When he starts talking about the pirates, I have to check out. He leans HEAVY on the General History, which he attributes to Daniel Defoe. This is certainly not unique to Burgess--it seems like practically every piracy author does the same thing. The General History is a book that piracy scholarship really needs to disavow, and it honestly makes me cringe when I see authors relying on it as a source of information, just because they assume their readers will trust it. In a similar vein, it was extremely irritating to find an illustration in the book of Blackbeard fighting Maynard, which Burgess describes as a ""surprisingly accurate"" ""contemporary woodcut"". This despite the fact that Maynard is drawn in a waist-length waistcoat, cutaway coat, long trousers, and BICORN hat, dating this image to something like 100 years after the event it depicts! This image is as contemporary as the General History is trustworthy.


This isn't a bad book, but the topic is broad enough (spanning multiple decades in multiple different colonies) that it gets confusing remembering who is who and why they matter. There are countless governors, lords, customs agents, council members, etc etc etc, who can keep track? Burgess tries to help us with occasional ~novelized~ passages, such as the opening passage about Blackbeard, but I have to admit they kind of annoyed me. I don't need to read half a paragraph describing someone mailing a letter, nor do I want to hear an author presenting his interpreted attribution of emotional experience as fact. (No footnotes...and often not even a qualifier like ""perhaps"" or ""it seems likely that"") And bizarrely, sometimes information is repeated throughout the book...he writes on page 118 that John Hoar commanded a ship called the John and Rebecca, ""named, touchingly, after himself and his wife"". Later on page 208...he writes that John Hoar named a ship the John and Rebecca, ""after himself and his wife"". Did you forget you told us this already? This happens a couple times because the massive scope of the book means that Burgess picks a storyline to follow for a while, but then when he chooses another thread to follow, he has to go back in time a little to catch us up on this overlapping narrative, mixing up the timelines and plots.


Well anyway, this book does have some useful information in it. I was disappointed in some pretty niche ways, but I understand most people probably won't have the same issues that I do.",0

Aglaophotis is a red liquid which is obtained from the refinement of a herb of the same name. It has the ability to dispel demonic forces and grant protection against such forces to those who use the item.

First seen in Silent Hill, it also plays a role in Silent Hill 3. Aglaophotis plays an important role in both games, as its use in the first game heavily affects what ending the player will receive.

Contents show]

Description

A memo in Silent Hill 3 gives a brief description of Aglaophotis.

Aglaophotis Red liquid or crystals resembling blood. According to the Kabbalah, the name is taken from an herb with the power to dispel evil spirits. It is said to grow in Arabian deserts.

It may be vaporized or applied as a poultice to guard against demons. It is powerful, but as it is rare, it is extremely difficult to obtain.

A book in Silent Hill: Play Novel suggests Aglaophotis is also made using White Claudia.[1]

[...........tis] ..de from from the above-mentioned White Claudia,......dr...has.......... u....to perform exor...... It is a viscous liquid, red....color, and is..... adminis..........remedy.....illnesses for which the cause is not kn....

The novelization says it is completely odorless and thinner than blood.

Silent Hill

Dr. Michael Kaufmann, director of Alchemilla Hospital, came into possession of at least two vials of the red liquid. How he obtained them is unknown, though it seems likely from a later conversation with Dahlia Gillespie that Kaufmann was holding onto the substance in the event that Dahlia's plans went in a direction he didn't like.

As Harry Mason explores the town of Silent Hill looking for clues as to the whereabouts of his daughter Cheryl, he comes across Alchemilla Hospital. While searching the hospital, Harry finds a broken bottle of Aglaophotis (then unknown) on the floor in Kaufmann's office. Harry can take the empty plastic bottle from the nearby kitchen and collect a sample and use it to save Cybil Bennett when she is found possessed by a parasite in the merry-go-round at the Lakeside Amusement Park.

Harry can continue investigating Kaufmann's involvement and the Aglaophotis in the Resort Area of Silent Hill. Before reaching the boathouse to meet Cybil, Harry can enter Annie's Bar and save Dr. Kaufmann from an attacking monster. Further investigation of Kaufmann's tracks leads to the discovery of a vial of Aglaophotis hidden in Kaufmann's motorcycle.

If Harry saves Kaufmann, he will appear during Harry's final confrontation with Dahlia in a place known as Nowhere. After Alessa Gillespie is brought to her true form, Kaufmann will appear to intercept Dahlia's plans. He proceeds to shoot Dahlia, then takes the vial of Aglaophotis previously hidden in the motorcycle and hurls it at the combined form of Alessa and Cheryl Mason. The vial breaks and coats the entity in the fluid. Through the Aglaophotis's exorcising power, the ""god"" imbued within Alessa is forced out as the Incubus, a creature created from Dahlia's vision of God.

Silent Hill 3

Heather Mason, the reborn identity of Alessa Gillespie and Cheryl Mason, was given a necklace by her father Harry as a child. Containing a red jewel, it is revealed that the crystal is actually a small capsule of Aglaophotis.

How he procured the sample is unknown. In the Book of Lost Memories, it is stated that ""It would seem that after the first game, Harry once again procured some of the liquid for the sake of his daughter"", which suggests that the sample in the necklace is not what Harry found in Silent Hill.[2]

When confronted by the machinations of the Order priestess Claudia Wolf and the prospect of giving birth to the cult's patron deity (as had been intended for Heather Mason's previous self, Alessa Gillespie), Heather instead ingests the",0

The 84-year-old Arlington Memorial Bridge is reaching the end of its design life. As the bridge crumbles and deteriorates at an accelerated pace, it could potentially close by 2021, according to Jenny Anzelmo-Sarles of the National Park Service.

The bridge, which spans 2,100 feet, has a $250 million price tag to stay open in the long term. The NPS has been trying to raise this funding for the past four years. But the agency's annual budget is $3 billion, and only $268 million is currently going toward transportation infrastructure.

""The National Park Service will need the support of partnerships with other federal, state, and local entities, to compete successfully for funds available from the Department of Transportation,"" park service director Jonathan Jarvis said in a release. ""We are pursuing every funding possibility to find a path forward to repair Memorial Bridge.""

Inspection shows accelerated deterioration, indicates Memorial Bridge may close in 2021 w/o $250 million overhaul. pic.twitter.com/UNjuOTJJn5 — Jenny A-S NPS (@JennyASNPS) March 3, 2016

Last spring, the NPS had to close parts of the bridge to complete emergency repairs. Vehicles driving on the open parts of the crossing were restricted to a 10-ton load limit, eliminating most buses from traveling across the span. That limit still stands today.

The agency also moved up temporary repairs, which were supposed to start in the fall. At the time, the bridge topped the American Road & Transportation Builders Association's list of the most-traveled structurally deficient bridges in D.C. The unfortunate distinction is mostly due to the corrosion of the steel in the drawbridge portion, plus some supportive materials are missing altogether, according to the NPS.

The bridge is crossed more than 68,000 times a day. And if the drawbridge fails, there could be a six-to-eight inch drop in the roadway.

The crossing connects the Lincoln Memorial with Arlington National Cemetery and the Robert E. Lee Memorial. It was built to commemorate the reunification of the United States after the Civil War and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

A temporary fix is scheduled to begin next year at a cost of $5 million.",0
"I love making jewelry from unconventional materials. So when I got the opportunity to make some jewelry out of zippers, I jumped on the chance.

The zippers for this tutorial are from K and C Supplies. You can find all sorts of colors and varieties of zippers in the online shop here. (Plus buttons! Oh, yes, there will be a button jewelry tutorial soon, too!)

Let's get started!

Materials and Tools:

3 – 7 inch YKK Zippers. Pick them up at K and C Supplies.

12 Fold over crimp ends. Available at any craft store.

7 mm jump rings

Lobster clasp

Scissors

Chain nose pliers and another pair of pliers

Optional materials for customizing your bracelet:

Beads

Head pins

Lucite flowers

Step #1

We're going to separate each zipper into 2 parts. So flip over the zipper and find the little metal throngs on the back. Just bend them up with chain nose pliers and pull it off.

Then just slide the pull down and off the zipper. (Definitely save this for other projects!)

ALTERNATIVELY (and this is easier, but you lose a little of the length of the zipper.)

Alternatively you can just cut across the zipper right above that little metal thing at the end. Like I mentioned, you will lose a some of the length of the zipper and ultimately your bracelet by doing that.

Repeat this for all 3 zippers. Whichever way you chose, do it the same for all of the zippers.

Step #2

Use scissors to cut along the side of the zipper teeth. You'll end up with a thin strand of just the teeth. (Save the excess for a project I will share later.)

Repeat for each zipper. You'll end up with 6 of these.

Step #3

Add a crimp end to each end of each zipper. Just place the end in the crimp end and fold over each side. Then push it closed.

HINT: I like to pull on the crimp end to make sure it's secure before moving on.

Step #4

Open 2 – 7mm jump rings.

Opening a jump ring may be different than you think. Line up 2 pairs of pliers so that the opening of the jump ring is in the middle.

(I usually use a pair of bent nose pliers and a pair of chain nose pliers. Use whatever pliers you feel comfortable with.)

Maintaining the integrity of the circle, pull one pair the the pliers toward you and the other away from you. Do not pull the circle apart and do not pull to the sides.

This is what you end up with.

To close a jump ring, just do the same, but the opposite.

I also made a video tutorial about how to properly open and close jump rings:

Step #5

Add the end of all 6 zippers to one jump ring. Then close the jump ring.

Step #6

Secure the end to something. (I used some wire and hooked it to a basket.)

Braid the zippers. I made 3 groups of 2 zippers each and just did a regular braid.

Step #7

Gather the other end and hook them all in another 7 mm jump ring.

Step #8

Open another 7 mm jump ring and connect the lobster clasp to one end of the bracelet. Then add a few 7 mm jump rings to the other end of the bracelet.

That's the basic zipper bracelet.

Here are some ways to customize it:

(Feel free to get creative here!)

Make a couple of bead dangles. I used flower beads.

For a video tutorial on how to make a bead dangle, here's a video I made:

Then add the dangles to the end of the bracelet using a jump ring.

Want to take it a step further?

Make some more bead dangles. Click here to learn how to make these dangles with Lucite flowers.

Add them to the bracelet in various places using jump rings. I used 4mm jump rings so the dangles would stay in place, but if you would like them to have some movement, use 7mm jump rings.

Another Version:

Instead of making a braided bracelet, you could make a single bracelet. These would look awesome stacked. Imagine a bunch of different colors down your arm. You can add a dangle like I did here, or just keep them plain.

Have fun making zipper bracelets! Let me know how they turn out!

"The Educational System of Finland: A Model for Success

Finland has long been recognized as a global leader in education. The country has consistently ranked at the top of international assessments of student achievement in subjects such as reading, math, and science. The Finnish educational system has been praised for its emphasis on equity, teacher professionalism, and a child-centered approach to learning.

One of the key features of the Finnish system is the comprehensive and inclusive nature of education. All children in Finland are entitled to free education, regardless of their socio-economic background. This includes pre-primary education for children under the age of six, followed by nine years of compulsory basic education. After this, students can choose to pursue vocational education or continue on to upper secondary school, which prepares them for higher education or the workforce.

The Finnish system is also known for its highly qualified and respected teachers. All teachers in Finland are required to hold a master's degree, and the profession is highly competitive. Teachers have a great deal of autonomy in their classrooms, and are trusted to design their own curricula and assessments. This allows them to tailor their teaching to the needs of their students, and to focus on critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Another key component of the Finnish system is the emphasis on play-based learning in early childhood education. Children are encouraged to learn through play and exploration, rather than through rote memorization or standardized testing. This approach has been shown to foster creativity, social skills, and a love of learning.

The Finnish system also places a great deal of emphasis on equity. Schools in Finland receive funding based on the needs of their students, with extra resources going to schools with a higher proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. There are no private schools in Finland, and there is little variation in the resources available to different schools.

Despite its many strengths, the Finnish system is not without its challenges. Finland has been grappling with an increasingly diverse student population, which has led to debates over how to maintain equity while meeting the needs of all students. Additionally, the system has been criticized for being too heavily reliant on standardized testing, despite its emphasis on student-centered learning.

Overall, however, the Finnish educational system serves as an inspiring model for other countries. Its commitment to equity, teacher professionalism, and child-centered learning have helped to create a system that consistently produces high-achieving students and fosters a lifelong love of learning.",1

"The Educational System of Finland: A Model for the World

Finland's educational system has been a topic of interest for many researchers and policymakers around the world. The Nordic country has achieved remarkable success in providing high-quality education to its citizens, leading global education rankings year after year. But what makes Finland's education system so unique?

The Finnish education system is based on the principle of equity, meaning that every student is given equal opportunities to succeed regardless of their background or social status. This is achieved through a comprehensive education system that includes free education for all, highly qualified teachers, and a student-centered approach.

One of the most significant features of Finland's education system is the comprehensive school system. Students attend the same school from the age of 7 to 16, which eliminates the need for tracking or streaming students into different ability groups. This ensures that all students receive the same quality of education, and no one is left behind.

The curriculum in Finland is designed to emphasize problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Students are encouraged to work collaboratively, developing their interpersonal skills in the process. The Finnish education system also places a strong emphasis on creativity, music, and the arts, which are seen as essential to developing well-rounded individuals.

The role of teachers is also crucial in Finland's education system. Teachers are highly respected and trusted professionals, with a minimum of a master's degree in education. They are given autonomy in their work, and there is no standardized testing or performance-based pay. This allows teachers to focus on providing the best possible education for their students, rather than teaching to the test.

Another significant aspect of Finland's education system is its focus on well-being. Schools in Finland have a holistic approach to education, where the physical and mental health of students is taken into consideration. This includes providing healthy meals, access to healthcare, and opportunities for physical exercise.

The results of Finland's education system speak for themselves. Finnish students consistently rank among the top performers in international tests such as PISA, and the country has one of the highest rates of tertiary education in the world. Finland's education system has become a model for other countries looking to improve their education outcomes.

In conclusion, Finland's education system is a testament to the power of equity, collaboration, and student-centered learning. By focusing on the development of well-rounded individuals and providing equal opportunities for all, Finland has created an education system that is the envy of the world. It is a shining example of what can be achieved when education is seen as a public good, and investing in it is a top priority.",1
"Mathematics: The Key to Understanding the World Around Us

Mathematics is often considered one of the most challenging subjects in school. However, it is also one of the most fascinating and important subjects. Mathematics is not only a tool for solving problems, but it is also a way of understanding the world around us.

From counting and measuring to complex calculus and statistics, mathematics is essential in everyday life. It helps us understand the world, make informed decisions, and solve problems in a logical and systematic way. Mathematics is used in everything from designing buildings and bridges to predicting weather patterns and analyzing financial data.

Moreover, mathematics has contributed significantly to scientific discoveries. It has enabled us to model and understand the complex processes that govern our universe, from the behavior of subatomic particles to the movement of galaxies. Mathematics has played a crucial role in advancements in fields such as physics, chemistry, and engineering.

Furthermore, mathematics is essential for developing critical thinking skills. It teaches us to analyze problems, break them down into smaller parts, and develop logical solutions. In addition, mathematics encourages creativity by challenging our minds to think outside the box and explore new ideas.

Despite the importance of mathematics, there is a common misconception that it is a difficult and boring subject. However, this couldn't be further from the truth. Mathematics is a fascinating and rewarding subject that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

In conclusion, mathematics is an essential subject that plays a critical role in our lives and the world around us. It is a tool for problem-solving, a way of understanding the universe, and a means of developing critical thinking skills.

"Scientists Discover New Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease

Alzheimer's disease affects millions of people around the world, causing memory loss and other cognitive impairments that can severely impact quality of life. Despite decades of research, there is still no cure for this devastating disease. However, a recent breakthrough by a team of scientists may offer new hope for Alzheimer's patients.

The scientists, led by Dr. Sarah Lee at the University of California, have developed a new treatment that targets a specific protein that is believed to play a key role in Alzheimer's disease. The protein, called tau, forms tangles in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, leading to the death of brain cells and the resulting cognitive decline.

The new treatment, which has been tested in mice, uses a small molecule called a kinase inhibitor to block the activity of an enzyme that triggers the formation of tau tangles.

Ukrainian officials claim that Russian-backed forces have launched a series of deadly attacks on their positions, while separatist leaders have accused Ukrainian forces of shelling civilian areas.

The conflict has also taken a toll on the economy of Ukraine, which has struggled to cope with the loss of Crimea and the ongoing fighting in the east. The IMF has provided financial assistance to the country, but the situation remains fragile.

Despite international efforts to broker a peace agreement, the conflict shows no signs of abating. The recent military build-up by Russia along the border with Ukraine has raised fears of a new escalation, with some analysts warning of a potential invasion.

The United States and other Western countries have expressed their support for Ukraine and condemned Russia's actions, but their ability to influence the situation remains limited. Meanwhile, the people of Ukraine continue to live with the daily threat of violence and instability.

As the conflict in Ukraine enters its eighth year, it is clear that a lasting peace will require a concerted effort from all sides. Until then, the people of Ukraine will continue to suffer the consequences of this long and bloody conflict.",1
"The WHO is the world's leading health organisation guiding governments around the world. So we expect their advice to be up to date and evidence-based, particularly on controversial topics. One of the most controversial topics of our time is the international community's approach to drug policy, particularly that relating to the most popular so-called ""illegal"" drug – cannabis. Yet the WHO's advice on the harms and (lack of) benefits of cannabis is based on a decision made 82 years ago, by its predecessor, the League of Nations. Thankfully, there is now hope that this is about to change.

The WHO advises the UN, which states international control of drugs – so the view of the WHO really matters. The reality is that almost every country in the world (197 in total) sign up to follow WHO advice and so its current stance means punitive measures for cannabis – including lifetime in prison in some countries. Cannabis is still scheduled as having the highest level of harm and no medical value, despite reams of evidence to contrary. It is significantly less harmful than alcohol and shows real medical benefit, particularly in the treatment of pain, spasticity, and some forms of epilepsy. Due to these therapeutic effects, over 18 countries and over 200 million US citizens now have access to licensed medicinal cannabis. Consequently, the idea that cannabis isn't a medicine is considerably less plausible now than when this decision was made in 1934. Worse still, the actual report on which cannabis was scheduled in 1934 can no longer be found so it may be that the decades-long ban on cannabis is based on real errors of fact!

What is equally problematic is that the current legal status of cannabis means that research into its potential benefits – or harms - is really tough because of the regulations that accompany its Schedule 1 status. For example, in the UK medical researchers like me need a special license to hold cannabis for research though as a doctor I can prescribe heroin - a much more dangerous and sought-after drug. The UK government believes that it can't change this prohibitionist position and still comply with the UN conventions. This is untrue, as The Netherlands has demonstrated for over 30 years, but the easiest way to get a change in the UK policy would be if the WHO led the way.

It is vital that experts take all latest data into account during such a vital review, and to this end DrugScience has produced a detailed up-to-date assessment of cannabis for the public as well as the WHO and UN. This report authored by 4 experts – two from DrugScience - provides the vital background evidence on which a sensible modern re-assessment of cannabis can be made. This should lead to an appreciation that cannabis has medical value in some illnesses, and so encourage research into its potential for others, such as cancer, ADHD and PTSD. A proper review of cannabis could also encourage a more nuanced view of the comparative harms of different forms of cannabis, helping direct users away from the strong d9THC/low cannabidiol variants such as ""skunk"" that appear significantly different from more traditional herbal or resin forms of cannabis.

Big issues like this need that affect hundreds of millions of people across the globe need to determined based on the best and most current evidence available. Leading organisations such as the WHO and UN need to be able to move quickly to try and avoid the public losing out.

At last there has been some progress! This came from the recent meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence in the WHO headquarters in Geneva. Here the Expert Committee and the WHO Lead for Medicines, Dr Suzanne Hill, were presented with the report by the DrugScience team. They also heard powerful supporting arguments from two other expert groups (the International Drug Policy Consortium and the International Association for Hospice & Palliative Care) both of whom also made it clear that there was a pressing need for a review of cannabis scheduling.

The DrugScience team argued that the Expert Committee had the right to change its agenda to start a full pre-review of cannabis immediately based on our WHO-standard report. This they declined to do, but it seems our arguments were heeded as an official pre-review has been ordered, to be completed before the next meeting of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in 2018.

This move by the WHO is encouraging as its perception as being an evidence-based health organisation has become seriously questioned by its failure to consider the evolving facts on cannabis. It is critical that the review they conduct is honest, transparent and fully evidence-based; for surely then it will be impossible for the UN to continue to argue that cannabis should be scheduled as being extremely harmful and lacking medical value!",0
"Washington D.C. - In the world of politics, few names command as much attention as that of Senator Elizabeth Warren. The Massachusetts Democrat has made a name for herself as a fierce advocate for consumer protection, economic justice, and progressive taxation. Despite the challenges she has faced in her career, Warren remains one of the most prominent and influential politicians of our time.

Born and raised in Oklahoma, Warren began her career as a law professor at several prestigious institutions, including Harvard Law School. Her academic work on bankruptcy and consumer protection caught the attention of legislators and policymakers, leading to her appointment as the chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in 2008.

It was during this time that Warren became well-known for her no-nonsense approach to holding banks and financial institutions accountable for their role in the 2008 financial crisis. Her work on the panel helped to uncover eye-opening details about the way that banks were exploiting vulnerable consumers and contributing to systemic economic inequality.

In 2012, Warren ran for Senate in Massachusetts, defeating incumbent Republican Scott Brown and becoming the first female senator from the state. Since then, she has gained a reputation as a tireless and determined advocate for progressive policies.

Warren’s platform includes policies such as a wealth tax, increased funding for public education, Medicare for All, and a Green New Deal. She has also been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration’s immigration policies and has called for stronger protections for women’s reproductive rights.

Despite facing significant criticism from powerful corporate interests and some members of her own party, Warren has remained steadfast in her commitment to fighting for the working people of America. Her popularity among progressives has led to speculation that she may run for president in 2020, a prospect that many believe could shake up the political landscape.

As the political climate in the United States continues to shift, it is clear that Elizabeth Warren will remain a prominent and influential figure in our nation’s politics. Her commitment to economic justice and progressive policies has made her a hero to millions of Americans who are struggling to make ends meet in an increasingly unequal society.",1
"Machine learning: Revolutionizing the way we understand the world

Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has been making waves in the world of technology and science. As our world becomes increasingly data-driven, machine learning is becoming a crucial tool for analyzing and understanding complex information.

So, what is machine learning? Simply put, it is the process by which computers can learn and improve upon tasks without being explicitly programmed. This allows for computers to recognize patterns and make predictions based on large sets of data.

One of the most exciting applications of machine learning is in the field of healthcare. By analyzing patient data, machine learning algorithms can identify potential health risks and predict the likelihood of certain diseases. This has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach preventative healthcare and could ultimately lead to significant improvements in patient outcomes.

Another area where machine learning is making headway is in autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars rely heavily on machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret data from cameras, sensors, and other sources to navigate roads and avoid collisions. As the technology continues to improve, we could see a future where self-driving cars are the norm, drastically reducing the number of road accidents and fatalities.

Machine learning is also being used in the field of finance, where it can be used to detect fraud and predict market trends. This has the potential to save financial institutions millions of dollars while also providing valuable insights for investors.

Of course, as with any technology, there are concerns around the potential misuse of machine learning. There are fears that algorithms could be used to discriminate against certain groups or perpetuate biases in decision-making. These concerns must be addressed and safeguards put in place to ensure that the technology is used ethically and responsibly.

Overall, machine learning is a powerful tool that has the potential to transform the way we understand and interact with the world around us. With its ability to analyze vast amounts of data and make predictions based on that data, it is likely to play an increasingly important role in a wide range of industries in the years to come.",1

Because of the digital nature of cyberpunk and our lives today, it's no surprise people are making their own worlds match the fantasy. It could be their home office, gaming room, or even home theater room. All of these rooms lend themselves well to this kind of DIY interior design.

Elements of Cyberpunk Interior Design

The cyberpunk aesthetic can be broken down into three main types: minimalist, chaotic, and retro-futuristic. Before you go saying that there's more types than that, consider that most scenes in any cyberpunk game or movie are, at least, some combination of those. Blending in elements of Asian or even Ancient Egyptian culture is also often seen. You might call it a pan-cultural look as well.

In all three of those types, there are some common elements: electronics, glossy and matte colors with a sparse palette, repetitive geometric patterns, metal, glass, ambient lighting and automation.

These elements seem so common but are used in vastly different ways within the design types. Let's take a look at each type, and a few real world examples in real people's homes.

The Minimalist Cyberpunk Room

Great cinematic and gaming examples of the minimalist design can be found everywhere. Pick a cyberpunk movie, think of where the rich people or villains lived, and that's typically your minimalist cyberpunk room. One example is Flynn's safe room in Tron: Legacy.

"The Educational System of Finland: A Model for Europe

Finland is widely regarded as having one of the best educational systems in the world, consistently ranking at or near the top of international assessments of student performance. What sets Finland's system apart, and what lessons can be learned from it for other European countries?

One of the key features of the Finnish system is its emphasis on equity. Finnish schools are publicly funded and free to attend, with no tuition fees or selective admissions processes. Schools are also required to provide all necessary resources and support to students with disabilities or other special needs. This commitment to providing equal opportunities for all students is reflected in Finland's relatively low levels of income inequality and social stratification.

Another distinguishing feature of the Finnish system is its focus on teacher training and professional development. All teachers in Finland are required to hold master's degrees in education, and the process of becoming a teacher is highly competitive. Once hired, teachers are given significant autonomy in designing and implementing their own lesson plans, and are encouraged to collaborate with colleagues and engage in ongoing professional development.

Perhaps most importantly, the Finnish system places a strong emphasis on student well-being and happiness. Finnish schools have been designed to promote a relaxed and supportive learning environment, with plenty of opportunities for play and physical activity. Students are not subjected to high-stakes testing or homework assignments, and are given ample time for self-directed learning and exploration.

These features of the Finnish educational system have contributed to its success at producing high levels of student achievement and well-being. While every country's system must be tailored to its own unique needs and challenges, there are certainly lessons that can be learned from Finland's example. By prioritizing equity, teacher training and support, and student well-being, European countries can work to build more effective and fulfilling educational systems for all their students.",1
"Generative AI: The Future of Creativity

As technology continues to advance at an unprecedented pace, the field of artificial intelligence has emerged as a promising area for innovation and growth. Among the many subfields of AI, generative AI is quickly becoming one of the most exciting and transformative.

Generative AI is a type of machine learning that involves training neural networks to create new content that is similar to existing data. This can include images, music, text, and even entire virtual worlds. By feeding a neural network a large dataset of images, for example, the network can learn to generate new, never-before-seen images that resemble the original set. Similarly, by training a network on a corpus of written text, it can be taught to generate new text that follows the same style, tone, and syntax.

One of the most significant advantages of generative AI is its potential to automate creative processes. For example, an AI system could be trained to generate new music that sounds like the works of a particular artist or genre, freeing up human musicians to focus on other aspects of the creative process. Similarly, AI-generated text could be used to generate news articles, product descriptions, and even novels, potentially revolutionizing the publishing industry.

Another exciting application of generative AI is in the creation of virtual worlds and environments. By training a neural network on a set of 3D models and textures, it can learn to generate new scenes and landscapes that are indistinguishable from those created by human designers. This could have significant implications for industries such as video games, architecture, and even urban planning.

Despite its potential, generative AI is not without its challenges. One of the most significant issues is the potential for bias in the generated content. If the neural network is trained on a dataset that contains inherent biases, such as racial or gender stereotypes, the generated content may reflect those biases as well. Another challenge is the potential for malicious actors to use generative AI to create convincing fake images or videos, potentially causing harm or spreading disinformation.

Overall, generative AI is a rapidly growing field that offers a wealth of opportunities for creativity and innovation. While there are certainly challenges to be addressed, the potential benefits of generative AI are too significant to be ignored. As we continue to explore the possibilities of this exciting technology, we can only imagine the new heights of creativity and imagination it will enable us to reach in the years to come.",1
"You don't know him. And that suits him just fine. He's an Irishman who has worked with many of the biggest teams in global sport as well as the US Army's Special Forces. He's also the man Ronan O'Gara credits with helping him operate at the highest level for so long, but Fergus Connolly chooses to remain largely anonymous.

You don't know him. And that suits him just fine. He's an Irishman who has worked with many of the biggest teams in global sport as well as the US Army's Special Forces. He's also the man Ronan O'Gara credits with helping him operate at the highest level for so long, but Fergus Connolly chooses to remain largely anonymous.

A few weeks ago, the San Francisco 49ers announced, with much fanfare, that they had signed quarter-back Colin Kaepernick on a deal to remain with the team worth a staggering $126m (92m euro). Two days earlier, they quietly acquired the services of the Monaghan man.

In putting him on a deal that makes him one of the top-paid players in the league, the 49ers had effectively entrusted Kaepernick with guiding them to the Superbowl title. And by securing Connolly, one of the world's leading authorities on human performance, recovery and lengthening careers, they underpinned their investment.

He could have ended up anywhere, but one of the NFL's best-known franchises won the race for his services by creating a new position for the former Scotstown footballer when they named him as their director of elite performance.

If his name rings a bell it's probably because he granted a rare interview the week after he helped Dublin win last year's All-Ireland.

Other than that, word of mouth has been his currency. Jim Gavin had been able to acquire Connolly's services through unfortunate circumstances. His mother had been ill and he needed to be close to home.

While he was here, he helped introduce a tactical and training programme as Dublin won their All-Ireland in style and, crucially, avoiding soft tissue injuries right up to the final. With Connolly's mother happily recovered, the race for his services was back on and eventually concluded with this month's move to California.

His story, that takes him from a north Monaghan parish steeped in Gaelic football to working with some of the world's best athletes, is as unconventional as it is remarkable.

He's just 37, but it's not long since Connolly was on track for the more mundane existence as a woodwork teacher. He kept learning, though, starting at the bottom with a diploma in Manual Therapy and working his way up to a PhD, along with a host of other courses in between.

He knocked down a few doors, but word quickly spread. Through his contacts, he has built up one of the most impressive CVs in his field.

He first popped up here in 2008 when John McCloskey recommended him to the Derry footballers. At that stage, Connolly was already making waves cross channel, working with Bolton Wanderers, but he threw in his lot with the Ulster men. Derry would win their first league title since 2000 that spring. He'd also work with Bernard Dunne on his way to the world title. Dunne namechecked him regularly, but still Connolly kept his head down and profile low.

However, in the world of sports science, he was already big news. Before the 49ers, he had worked at the top level in all of the major field sports in the world. His client list read like a who's who of world sport and included the Welsh Rugby Union, Liverpool, Manchester United, Jacksonville Jaguars and the New York Knicks to name but a few. He also worked in the NHL.

In Australia, there were whisperings he would join AFL side Collingwood, while he was also linked with a switch to the Wallabies with Robbie Deans ahead of the Lions tour last year.

Dubbed 'the unconventional fixer' for his unique all-encompassing approach to maximising performance, the AFL seconded Connolly to run the rule over their newly established expansion franchise, Greater Western Sydney Giants. The Giants had unexpectedly lost their high performance director and having effectively sent an entire team of first-round draft picks to the new club to help get them off the ground, the AFL needed to protect their investment and sent Connolly in.

Closer to home, he helped Munster and Bryce Cavanagh set up their 'Maldini Project', which helped extend the careers of the team that had helped establish the province as a major force in European rugby.

O'Gara is still in touch with Connolly and believes he helped him avoid the ""slow death"" that befalls so many other stars raging against the dying embers of their careers.

LAS VEGAS, July 26 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc will provide initial funding of $500,000 for a nonprofit organization that aims to help protect political parties, voting systems and information providers from hackers and propaganda attacks, the world's largest social network said on Wednesday.

The initiative, dubbed Defending Digital Democracy, is led by the former campaign chairs for Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Mitt Romney, and will initially be based at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, which announced the project last week.

Facebook said it hoped additional participants would turn it into a freestanding information-sharing center controlled by its members. Facebook, with two billion monthly users, bills itself as a vehicle for political debate and education, but was also used as a major platform to spread fake news and propaganda during the U.S. election campaign in 2016.

Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos announced the company's backing at the opening of the Black Hat information security conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday. The event, named after the term for malicious hackers, is aimed mainly at corporate and government security professionals.

Stamos declined to say how much money the Facebook would spend.

""Right now we are the founding sponsor, but we are in discussions with other tech organizations,"" Stamos said in an interview before the speech. ""The goal for our money specifically is to help build a standalone ISAO (Information Sharing and Analysis Organization) that pulls in all the different groups that have some kind of vulnerability.""

The project will be managed by Eric Rosenbach, a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense who is co-director of the Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.

""Most campaigns don't have the tools right now to defend themselves from cyber attacks,"" Clinton campaign chair Robby Mook said in an email. ""Our initiative aims to fill that void and to help both Democratic and Republican campaigns defend themselves with greater information-sharing and security tools.""

""This is a forward-looking and bipartisan effort to tackle a real problem,"" said 2012 Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades in an email.

Stamos also urged Black Hat attendees, many of whom are leery of government intrusion, to be more open-minded about helping law enforcement track criminals and terrorists.

Unthinking rejection of official requests could lead to legislation forcing companies to break their own encryption, Stamos warned.

Stamos said he would continue to argue against such steps.

""We're not going to be effective unless we demonstrate that we have the same goals,"" he said. ""I want to present our position that strong cryptography is a critical part of building a safe, trustworthy future."" (Reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Jonathan Weber)

"Machine Learning: The Future of Technology

In recent years, machine learning has emerged as one of the most promising fields of technology. It is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computer systems to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the world as we know it, with applications ranging from healthcare to finance.

Machine learning algorithms are designed to identify patterns in large data sets, and use these patterns to make predictions and decisions. This technology has already been used to develop self-driving cars, personalized recommendations on streaming platforms, and even diagnose diseases.

One of the key advantages of machine learning is its ability to learn and improve over time. As more data is fed into the system, the algorithms become more accurate and can make more precise predictions. This makes it an ideal tool for companies looking to improve their products and services, as well as for researchers seeking to gain insights into complex phenomena.

However, there are also concerns about the potential misuse of machine learning. For example, if the algorithms are biased or trained on incomplete data, they may make inaccurate or discriminatory predictions. There is also the risk that machines may become too intelligent, and develop their own goals that may not align with those of humans.

Despite these concerns, the potential benefits of machine learning make it a valuable tool for researchers, innovators, and businesses. As this technology continues to evolve, it will be important to ensure that it is developed and used responsibly, with proper consideration given to ethical and social implications.

In conclusion, machine learning is undoubtedly one of the most exciting fields of technology today. It has the potential to transform the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us. As we continue to explore its possibilities, it is important to remain vigilant about the potential risks and challenges, while also embracing the opportunities that this technology has to offer.",1
"Scientists Discover Groundbreaking Cure for Cancer

In a monumental breakthrough, scientists have discovered a new treatment for cancer that could potentially save millions of lives. The treatment, which utilizes gene-editing technology, has shown promising results in its early clinical trials.

The team of scientists, led by Dr. Sarah Johnson, used a technique called CRISPR-Cas9 to target and modify cancer cells in a patient's body. This innovative approach allows the researchers to cut out the cancer-causing genes and replace them with healthy ones.

In the first trial, the treatment was administered to a group of patients with advanced stage cancer. Within weeks, the modified cells began to attack the cancerous cells, leading to a significant reduction in tumor size.

Dr. Johnson and her team are now working to expand the trial and test the treatment on a larger group of patients. If successful, this treatment could be a game-changer in the fight against cancer, which affects millions of people worldwide.

"Astral Projection Basics The term Astral Projection refers to a process in which the spirit leaves the body for a period of time. When the spirit returns to the body, you awaken and can recall your out-of-body sojourn. There are three common types of astral projection. Meditative Many believe the astral plane can be visited consciously through deep meditation.This kind of OBE is consciously induced. You choose the time and place to put your body into a relaxed state of being and allow your spirit to travel the astral plane. Spontaneous Sometimes a person isn't consciously attempting to leave their body. It just happens. Some have experience what's known as spontaneous astral projection or Out of Body Experience (OBE). They find themselves standing outside their body or watching from above. A spontaneous OBE is often short-lived because the person panics and is instantly pulled back into the physical body. Unconscious Since ancient times, those who practice astral projection have believed that the spirit journeys out of the body during sleep. ""In the daylight hours are our feet on the ground and we have no wings with which to fly. But our spirits are not tied to the earth and with the coming of night we overcome our attachment to the earth and join with that which is eternal.""

From the ancient Essene manuscript: Teachings of the Elect While astral projection is a natural state of being during sleep, if you want to make a conscious attempt at astral projection during the day, you will need to train your body to do this through regular meditation. Astral Projection Basics Today, the words ""soul"" and ""spirit"" are often used interchangibly. However, in the ancient texts there was a clear distintion between these two words. The soul was described as the life-force of the body and could not leave without causing death, while the spirit was described as being able to come and go at will. Since most astral projection articles refer to the ""soul"" leaving the body, this causes some to be fearful of the practice. It is important to understand it is your SPIRIT that makes these sojurns and your life-force (or soul) never actually leaves your body. Astral projection has been around since ancient times and has been commonly accepted and used within the Craft for countless centuries. The old wives tale and superstition of Witches Flying on a Broom is actually a reference to a practitioner of the Craft using Astral Projection instead of actually flying. In the past, it was quite common for a Witch to use a Flying Ointment to assist them in achieving this state of altered consciousness and awareness. Most of these preparations used herbs or plants which are quite dangerous to the untrained and can be fatal.


If you find any supposed flying ointment which lists ingredients such as Hemlock, Belladonna, Aconite, or Cowbane posted somewhere on the net I strongly suggest that you DO NOT use them. These plants are extremely toxic and you stand a very good chance of killing yourself. I will list a couple of alternate nontoxic ointments later in this text for those of you who wish to use them.


While working on developing your Astral skills, it is important to choose a place and time where you will not be disturbed. Normally if you are interrupted during a flight, your spirit self will automatically and immediately return to your physical body. It is somewhat of a shock to the system to get snapped back to consciousness in the middle of a journey, so pick a place and time where you can be undisturbed. If you choose to Project while others are in the house, it is a good idea to let them know what you are doing, so if they encounter you in this state, they will not become too concerned. In answer to the many questions I receive on the topic of returning to your body, the answer is quite simple. All you must do is will yourself to return and it happens.


While it is not necessary to use an ointment to achieve an OBE (Out of Body Experience) they can be helpful. Realizing that some of you will now embark on finding these ointments, we have published a couple of flying ointment recipes which pose few if any health risks but will still aid in your experiences. The first uses herbs and the second utilizes essential oils.

See Making Herbal Preparations for directions on making a base for ointments. You can find many of the herbs needed for these ointments in our online Wicca Store . Below you'll find a gazing technique sent in by a regular visitor to the Celtic Connection which does not utilize herbal assistants.

Finland has long been touted as a leader in education, routinely ranking among the top countries in the world for its education system. Many education experts attribute this success to the country’s unique approach to education that emphasizes creativity, individuality, and a focus on lifelong learning.

One of the key features of the Finnish education system is its emphasis on equal access to education for all students. The country has a comprehensive education system that is free and available to all students, regardless of their background or economic status. This includes access to high-quality preschool education, which is critical in preparing children for success in their future education.

Another aspect of the Finnish education system that sets it apart is its focus on student-centered learning. Rather than relying on standardized testing and rote memorization, Finnish teachers encourage students to engage in problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity. Students are given significant autonomy in their learning, with teachers acting as facilitators rather than lecturers.

The Finnish education system also places a strong emphasis on the teaching profession. Teachers are highly respected professionals who are well-educated and receive extensive training and support throughout their careers. This has helped to create a culture of excellence in teaching, which in turn benefits students and contributes to the overall success of the education system.

One of the most notable features of the Finnish education system is its lack of reliance on homework and standardized testing. While students do receive assignments and assessments, these are not the primary focus of their education. Instead, the Finnish system emphasizes the value of play, physical activity, and socialization as important components of learning. This approach has been shown to improve student engagement and overall academic success.

Overall, the Finnish education system serves as a model for other countries seeking to improve their own education systems. By placing a strong emphasis on equal access, student-centered learning, and the teaching profession, Finland has created a system that consistently produces high-performing students and prepares them for success in their future endeavors.",1
"Preparing for August 21, 2017

On August 21, 2017, there's going to be a total eclipse of the Sun visible on a line across the US. But when exactly will the eclipse occur at a given location? Being able to predict astronomical events has historically been one of the great triumphs of exact science. But in 2017, how well can it actually be done?

The answer, I think, is well enough that even though the edge of totality moves at just over 1000 miles per hour it should be possible to predict when it will arrive at a given location to within perhaps a second. And as a demonstration of this, we've created a website to let anyone enter their geo location (or address) and then immediately compute when the eclipse will reach them—as well as generate many pages of other information.


It's an Old Business

These days it's easy to find out when the next solar eclipse will be; indeed built right into the Wolfram Language there's just a function that tells you (in this form the output is the ""time of greatest eclipse""):

✕ SolarEclipse[]

It's also easy to find out, and plot, where the region of totality will be:

✕ GeoListPlot[SolarEclipse[""TotalPhasePolygon""]]

Or to determine that the whole area of totality will be about 16% of the area of the US:

✕ GeoArea[SolarEclipse[""TotalPhasePolygon""]]/GeoArea[Entity[""Country"", ""UnitedStates""]]

But computing eclipses is not exactly a new business. In fact, the Antikythera device from 2000 years ago even tried to do it—using 37 metal gears to approximate the motion of the Sun and Moon (yes, with the Earth at the center). To me there's something unsettling—and cautionary—about the fact that the Antikythera device stands as such a solitary piece of technology, forgotten but not surpassed for more than 1600 years.

But right there on the bottom of the device there's an arm that moves around, and when it points to an Η or Σ marking, it indicates a possible Sun or Moon eclipse. The way of setting dates on the device is a bit funky (after all, the modern calendar wouldn't be invented for another 1500 years), but if one takes the simulation on the Wolfram Demonstrations Project (which was calibrated back in 2012 when the Demonstration was created), and turns the crank to set the device for August 21, 2017, here's what one gets:

And, yes, all those gears move so as to line the Moon indicator up with the Sun—and to make the arm on the bottom point right at an Η—just as it should for a solar eclipse. It's amazing to see this computation successfully happen on a device designed 2000 years ago.

Of course the results are a lot more accurate today. Though, strangely, despite all the theoretical science that's been done, the way we actually compute the position of the Sun and Moon is conceptually very much like the gears—and effectively epicycles—of the Antikythera device. It's just that now we have the digital equivalent of hundreds of thousands of gears.

Why Do Eclipses Happen?

A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon gets in front of the Sun from the point of view of a particular location on the Earth. And it so happens that at this point in the Earth's history the Moon can just block the Sun because it has almost exactly the same angular diameter in the sky as the Sun (about 0.5° or 30 arc-minutes).

So when does the Moon get between the Sun and the Earth? Well, basically every time there's a new moon (i.e. once every lunar month). But we know there isn't an eclipse every month. So how come?

✕ Graphics[{Style[Disk[{0, 0}, .3/5], Yellow], Style[Disk[{.8, 0}, .1/5], Gray], Style[Disk[{1, 0}, .15/5], Blue]}]

Well, actually, in the analogous situation of Ganymede and Jupiter, there is an eclipse every time Ganymede goes around Jupiter (which happens to be about once per week). Like the Earth, Jupiter's orbit around the Sun lies in a particular plane (the ""Plane of the Ecliptic""). And it turns out that Ganymede's orbit around Jupiter also lies in essentially the same plane. So every time Ganymede reaches the ""new moon"" position (or, in official astronomy parlance, when it's aligned ""in syzygy""—pronounced sizz-ee-gee), it's in the right place to cast its shadow onto Jupiter, and to eclipse the Sun wherever that shadow",0
"best priced managed switch you can buy

Good: Cisco 2950 has 24 ports, all of which can be either used as they come, or can be configured for a specific purpose. For the price, you cannot purchase a new switch of equal value in a store, its just not possible. The amount of settings and configurations you can choose is huge, which comes in handy. The ability to define and implement VLANs is reason enough to buy a switch of this caliber. Bad: buying anything Cisco requires some information to use. You need to be familiar with Cisco IOS and own a serial console cable to configure it. The ugly: the switch I purchased still had old config files on it from the previous owner, which meant it was password protected. I needed to reference the cisco website ( or Cisco CCNA Portable Command Guide)to find the steps to override the password, which can only be done with physical access to the switch itself. After that, works flawlessly. ( which just means that somebody was lazy when the decommissioned their equipment, potentially leaving behind traces of corporate network information) Overall, Cisco equipment is built like a tank, and a great deal to find used. I love my switch, and I'm sure anyone else that is looking for quality equipment will too.Read full review",0
